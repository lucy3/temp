40313	pos	I was totally amazed actually, how isolated they managed to make the place feel.
40314	pos	The prices are decent, (3 topping medium pizza is $12), but its the quality of the dough and ingredients they use.

40371	neg	Kindness  should not be returned with attitude.
40372	neg	My only problem really with this place is that they allow smoking.
