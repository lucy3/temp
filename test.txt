42222		Had to remind him to toast the sandwich.
42223		Nothing like what we expected, but even more!!
42224		Drive through is always packed.
42225		The one downside is that you often have to wait for a table, especially if you want to sit outside.
42226		At first we were a little concerned about the price.
42227		The only note I would offer is that the place can be a little pricey (almost $30 for two if us).
42228		I was forced to order an entree at lunchtime.
42229		Parking in the area is kind of tricky
42230		AC went out at 7:30 this morning, Howard Air was answering phones at 7:45 am, they were here by 10:30 and had the problem fixed by noon.
42231		When we arrived, I presented the voucher (which you have to do at any business that uses them), we were seated and all was well.
42232		I also do not believe they put the additional sugar on the waffles as these compared to Ballantyne are decidedly less sweet and crunchy.
42233		Also I strongly recommend you request him as your dive instructor if you plan on going with this company.
42234		I came in and mentioned the diagnostics I have had previously, but that I was concerned that diagnostic issue isn't what's causing the problem I felt unsafe about.
42235		Mmmmm and their hot wings with fresh garlic, as I love them, to die for!
42236		My stomach was churning, my head was throbbing, so I didn't savor my food so I left my friends there and took the shuttle back.
42237		The salmon roe was a little lacking.
42238		it was such a tease having a balcony but not being able to use it.
42239		I'm not one of those customers that is hard to please I just want the same respect I give & I rarely get that here.
42240		I'll gladly be a return customer.)
42241		Respect the lobster.
42242		Dr. Reiss isn't practicing as much as he used to (although I was adjusted by him once, he was great!
42243		They aren't anything to write home about.
42244		This place is hilariously trashy.
42245		Well done, jerks!
42246		Made me even more nervous because it was becoming realistic!
42247		I did get seated pretty fast.
42248		Had dinner with a large group last night and it was a comedy of errors from start to finish.
42249		"AMAZING AND CHEAP
Thank you Yelp for introducing this place to me."
42250		Don't bring a date to this place, because you don't want to run into them here if it doesn't work out.
42251		First and last time.
42252		So maybe I'm too picky.
42253		The front desk people were pleasant and they did push EWC's products but not to the point where I was uncomfortable and put-off.
42254		Not only does this put a wrench in everything, but the poor guy who waits on you first gets the brunt of it.
42255		OK, and WHY is that my problem?
42256		Learn how to speak to people guys!
42257		The owners were sitting right next to us and were sure to get us our check before offering dessert because we dare to be unimpressed with their garbage.
42258		it is a bit greasy tho.
42259		It however is not all you can eat.
42260		I used to go to the V's at Kierland but have never received a haircut I was happy with.
42261		As our appetizers arrived (hummus for hubby and Mac & Cheese for me) it was an absolute eyegasm!
42262		I've tried many salons near my residence but no one can do my hair to my satisfaction.
42263		Having lived in Minnesota, home of Caribou Coffee, I find the burnt coffee of Starbucks disgusting.
42264		It was very nice so we decided to stay again .
42265		The second time I went was with a large group of people (~12), which given the size of the place, proved to be a bit of a chore.
42266		They still had no idea who I was after I talked to them for 10 minutes, trying to jog their memory.
42267		But, the best part are the cuts & the staff.
42268		Always crowded
42269		It might seem like a weird thing to write a review for someone who I didn't end up using BUT I'll tell you this-- there are companies out there willing to do anything to sucker you out of your money.
42270		Make sure to shake the bag up good so the sauce gets everywhere!
42271		Oh did I mention that it's buttered greasily too?
42272		Many of the 4 and 5 star reviews I have found to be odd after visiting the restaurant.
42273		He makes it to where you kinda forget your getting your teeth drilled out.
42274		What a terrific place that was.
42275		I then proceeded to ask her why she was being so nasty and somehow her voice changed to a sweet apologetic angelic voice and a smile then appeared with an oh I'm sorry I didn't know I was coming across that way.
42276		As I went to get the car, I was given a slip which stated the vehicle was in perfect condition.
42277		Servers were nice, polite and friendly.
42278		Food cooked fresh.
42279		Yes, the free air check/refill thing is nice and it worked out well when the hot and cold tire pressure stuff starts.
42280		It does not seem they are slipping it seems more like a Fall a dive in quality and flavor, not a swan dive, a NOSE Dive!
42281		There's a good amount of parking.
42282		The small dinner plate is massive, could barely finish it.
42283		Was crowded when we got there and an even longer line when we met.
42284		"Naturally you would assume the vegan GF and dairy free coconut base ""suggested flavors"" would qualify as vegan GF and dairy free as well, however just to be sure we told them about the allergies before ordering and they assured her coconut flavor has no dairy."
42285		So while the membership is month to month, you cannot cancel the personal training.
42286		I have heard amazing reviews about this place for their breakfast but my family and I decided to try it out for a late lunch.
42287		After asking them about it twice or so!
42288		Don't expect to sit at the bar unless you get there right at 5pm.
42289		He still honored my two waffle bowl ice cream order.
42290		I'm always excited when I have a dish that is not something I could make better.
42291		As I stated initially, GREAT idea.
42292		Finally got acknowledged and seated.
42293		MAJOR POINTS!
42294		Every time we've been I would've tipped 100% (if I could afford it).
42295		We arrived slightly early, but were seated quickly outside.
42296		We also noticed that their food FINALLY came a long while later.
42297		You feel like you are staying at a luxurious resort, but the price does not reflect that.
42298		Come one guys lets keep stuff maintained.
42299		The drinks on the menu are pretty cheap though.
42300		They serve a lot of food for the price, we could not finish all the meat served.
42301		Me and my mother spent another HOUR together cleaning up after they left!
42302		I had the bean soup for the appetizer, which really wasn't bad.
42303		Unless there has been a high demand then his system can be slow.
42304		I just had my dog spayed by Dr. Brandt yesterday, and I literally can barely see an incision mark (and it's only been one day).
42305		Being in NJ while my mother was in Scottsdale, this is nerve racking.
42306		My partner and I split a burrito and both left full.
42307		Chopped salad is enough of a meal in itself.
42308		It dont even taste this good overseas damn!!!!
42309		They bribe me with douchebaggery.
42310		I was getting a huge deal so I agreed.
42311		What kind of place doesn't give out their number?
42312		I ordered the Baseball Cut Sirloin which, according to the menu, is only served rare or medium rare(a great sign as far as my reverence detector is concerned.)
42313		The tour guide must have read my face of dissapointment because she then went into the story of how the house was restored.
42314		It is authentic Chinese trash.
42315		It was less than an hour later and i was back in their office being handed my keys.
42316		I went in yesterday because I just wanted a nice relaxed swedish massage.
42317		I ate the entire bowl.
42318		See in LA, you get all these sauces at the table for FREE and they are authentic and damn good.
42319		Alas, the Sundance Cinema serves Coca Cola from its fountain but it also serves many other tasty carbonated drinks in the bottle.
42320		I ordered 4 pieces of tuna and salmon, and shrimp tempura/rice.
42321		I left and within 5 minutes smudged one finger beyond recognition so I drove back and they very nicely fixed it for me.
42322		Donna Hill killed it this morning in spin!
42323		It tastes aaaammmaazzzing!
42324		I have tried to get my nails done here 3 times and they have never had enough staff!!!
42325		Crancky ladies taking orders.
42326		This is not my first rodeo at Bouchon and certainly not my last.
42327		Secondly if you have yet to try MOFONGO,  what the h-e double hockey sticks are you waiting for?
42328		And they are so proud of their service for some reason.
42329		Shit...they even hooked us both up with free bottles of water while we waited.
42330		He then gave me a fairly awkward blow out (he seemed really inexperienced).
42331		I ordered the Ginger Cosmo and I'd say I'd definitely not order that off the menu again.
42332		Sure, it would be nice to have a few Fiaschetta di Vino, but, alas, here in America, that is not allowed.
42333		First, it's kind of hard to find.
42334		Hotel was very old sorta creepy feel.
42335		He then picks up our tray with food still in it!
42336		The menu is clearly marked with GF items and they have a separate prep area.
42337		Great food!
42338		I had one complaint:  One of the bartender (a blonde woman), would not give me water!
42339		It was unfortunate that my trip was cut short.
42340		Boy did we feel out of place.
42341		The Good: The atmosphere was lovely.
42342		This is not a fly by night chop shop.
42343		The bread and varieties are good and cheap.
42344		I hope you LOVE patchouli...  EVERYTHING FROM THIS STORE SMELLS LIKE PATCHOULI.
42345		The wait wasn't long at all and they were quite busy.
42346		I had asked about it and Bert immediately said it was my fault for using lotion and putting my arm on the arm rest and it wasn't under warranty.
42347		"Clean Grounds
Very friendly and helpful valet."
42348		Pretty cheap and did mention; there's a Polaroid museum for free up stairs.
42349		Five of the eight in our group ordered fried chicken and ALL WERE FRIED DRIED!
42350		As time went by, I realized my brows were getting thinner and thinner...and scarier!
42351		I have never received any attitude about this request before from any restaurant!
42352		Please Fired Up, hear my plea and become the food that you look like you serve.
42353		Best part of the whole place other than the food is the Japanese style cubby hole tables they have in the back.
42354		One of the ladies even hung up on me.
42355		We didn't want the soju so we omitted it, but they forgot the bean paste soup and steamed egg!
42356		As for the location this is just south of the strat and on the same side, its right near a tattoo parlor which if you want to get a bit of ink and wanna sit in the window on show while they do it, thats the place to go.
42357		A couple came after our 45 minutes of waiting and were seated and had food in less than 10 mins.
42358		One thing I hate is rooms that smell old and musty or when you check-in after a long day of travel and something doesn't work.
42359		When I got to urgent care I did not want to wait all night.
42360		In a word...bland!
42361		Nothing has been bland, scarce, over seasoned, under seasoned, lacking complexity, or unpleasing to my palate.
42362		She played us.
42363		There are several other foodie events throughout the week leading up to this one that are worth checking out.
42364		Or ANYWHERE ELSE but THERE!!!!
42365		It's a pretty busy place so finding a place to sit down might be difficult.
42366		The server was delightful.
42367		"Get some
Management with experience to handle situations vs someone who can't handle
Any situation with some aggression!"
42368		After spending the last week eating his leftovers, I've gone up 2 pants sizes, my vision has diminished and I can barely feel my feet.
42369		It's kind of funny how 2 more bartenders appeared just as happy hour ended.
42370		Try the Luxor people it has soft beds and your kids can use the accomodations!
42371		He obviously knew we were a little bothered by the in house brews not being available.
42372		At only 70K I had to get a new transmission for my 2007 VW Jetta Wolfsburg edition.
42373		Having lived in DC and having been to one of the originals, I've gotta say it kind of saddens me to see 5Guys go global.
42374		I'm so glad I was one of the few who went upstairs to decorate our friend's bachelorette suite while we left some of the girls to hang by the pool.
42375		Other lash studios put on lashes that were too heavy for my lashes, as well as glue that irritated my eyes.
42376		I just wish they had a tad more emphasis on food.
42377		However, the baristas have always seemed to be in a decent mood overall and handle having a line to the door and their drive thru very well.
42378		Anthony's across the street has great breakfast fo nascent prices and excellent service.
42379		We arrived and were promptly seated in a huge corner booth.
42380		Try the Dark Knight, it's my personal favorite
42381		He refused to doscount the meal and when asked to cook the rare steak a little more he brought out a well done steak.
42382		But do your job!
42383		So many Chinese restaurants offer the basic chinese food, and seem to use really small shrimp and un-recognizable meats.
42384		Previous visits merited satisfied customers, including my friend's fiancee who is notoriously hard to please (he's not so much picky as a perfectionist with high expectations for quality food).
42385		The decor was confusing though.
42386		I had it 2 months ago when they lost 4 pieces of our clothes.
42387		They must forget some people don't travel often.
42388		I would be there way too often and would probably give them all of my money.
42389		but the last few times ive been here the crowd has been consistently STRANGE.
42390		Half the channels in spanish, not that I go to Vegas to watch TV but when I get up to see the weather for the day I would like to see it in HD.
42391		More motorized scooters than I care to remember.
42392		Cockcroach Heaven.
42393		and when you grab the fries, have him dust a little extra of his secret seasoning salt on em..bbboooommmbbbbbbb
42394		Wait hours in line to check in - no joke.
42395		If that is unbeatable customer service that can't be beat then like I said, we're all in trouble.
42396		It's a small space and there is only so much room to hold workers.
42397		The dogs just run around and play all day then come home nice and tired.
42398		too bad I left it in the work fridge (Oh, no!
42399		Thank you chef for following instructions.
42400		I almost gave him the finger, but priority was to console the irate princess.
42401		Good polish selection and front desk is the most positive point of this place.
42402		Or was he- Q ended up taking us back- but since Craig quit- had 24 people in a van for maybe 16 - some people were sitting on the floor- if ur in the back of the bus you get no ac- but on the way out I sat up front- passenger an didn't feel air- driving the atv was definitely worth the time here- worth the money,is your decision- everything here in Vegas is overpriced - EVERYTHING-didn't grab a receipt - didn't think hell would happen or would have turned them in the the better business bureau
42403		Not a place where they love to recommend things, they like to keep the line moving so decide what you want before you get up to order.
42404		"I'm not going to lie at this point I was getting angry but I made sure I remained calm and said, ""SIR, is there anything you can do?"""
42405		Only issue is higher rates for any cleaning after a suspended (by us) appointment due to our being away for vacation.
42406		I'll be going to San Tan Foot & Ankle from now on!
42407		If your looking for authentic Mexican food, I can't say that it is.
42408		The portions are huge but before you know it, you will have eaten the whole thing.
42409		"As no place is perfect, there are two areas in which TruFusion can improve:
1."
42410		I think we will go back there again sometime as we love Mediterranean food.
42411		This is probably not a huge concern for most people because I sat down and ate the whole thing in 5 minutes.
42412		He said it was ok.  First thing you know, the owner came over to try to make it right.
42413		The monorail stops in the lobby of the hotel so getting around the city would have been easy.
42414		Cooks walking around listening to music like it wasn't busy.
42415		But the best part by far was the duck breast.
42416		Driving here wasn't bad; it's not too deep in china town that traffic will be horrendous.
42417		She would not leave the table.
42418		We've been to streets of New York before at the centennial hills location and it was good.
42419		Good thing I had a Fandango gift card for the tickets.
42420		Replacement pizza arrived 2 hours after my initial order with crust just as bas and ice cold.
42421		Have good outside seating area.
42422		I believe it was done intentionally because I didn't want the older rude nail technician to do my pedicure.
42423		We have been patrons of the Henderson location for about seven years.
42424		A city with way too many bridges.
42425		No jerk.
42426		I came here to eat with some friends during a trip because the exterior looked good.
42427		All drinks and most food are 50% off from 4-7 everyday.
42428		Give them a try.
42429		But that sitter never showed up, she was completely MIA!
42430		Cashier was knowledgeable and was able to tell me everything that came on the salad.
42431		Okay, I cried.
42432		My favorite part of dinner was the soup.
42433		reserved and paid for the car online $20.37,  got there and service member offered free upgrade because no compact car was available.
42434		The carbonara was cheesy with lots of bacon!
42435		A wheelchair can navigate its entrance.
42436		I just have one minor complaint.
42437		My Lamb Shawarma could only be described as Lamb Jerky, Rice, and Tomatoes...
42438		Much better service!
42439		Save yourself the hassle and headache of a poorly run business.
42440		The show is inexpensive and you get way more than your money's worth.
42441		It's a little hard to find, the strip mall blends in.
42442		On a positive note the fries weren't bad.
42443		Rooms are small.
42444		Even went out of their way to call another Dr. Office to get appointments bumped up so we could be seen at other doctor's office!!!
42445		And the best part is that I pricelined this hotel for $150/night.
42446		Really deserves NEGATIVE 5 stars.
42447		We LOVE OJs.
42448		The chicken was seriously the moistest chicken I've ever had.
42449		Just wish I could find some napkins around here!
42450		"Went to get a basic oil change at meineke, got hit with a bill of ""all the things wrong with my car"", left immediately."
42451		Only the bill was over the top!
42452		As with every hotel, there are a few areas of the hotel I would say are a little negative.
42453		Deep sighs, looking around as if trying to memorize the texture on the walls, and everything short of drumming their fingernails on the counter yelling 'OH COMMON!'
42454		I called our home warranty and they said it could be as late as Thursday before anyone could come out.
42455		I am convinced they keep their phones off the hook.
42456		I'm a huge skeptic when it comes to buying things online, specially with the news of all the exploding hover board.
42457		I was very excited to visit Olive & Gourmando after hearing so much about the place.
42458		Our waitress cooked our beef perfectly but she said we could cook it if we want, but we didn't.
42459		If you are an avid hiker or rock climber, then you'd want to make this an all day trip.
42460		The first pool guy we hired created so many problems for us by doing everything poorly and incorrectly.
42461		On a positive note, the vegetarian spring rolls were excellent.
42462		That was the only negative - the hostesses should have a better grasp.
42463		Travelocity = SCAM!!
42464		Finally when I did get help it was from a very nice young man that did his best to calm me down, thankyou I needed that , and he told me they have a new app that you can set up an appointment ahead of time and they will be waiting for you.
42465		I will start by saying that the drinks and ambiance  were very good.
42466		We had a few setbacks at first- upon arriving they couldn't find the vehicle from their website.
42467		While we waited the same cashier came over and give us a sample of the BBQ chips.
42468		Saw their menu for breakfast and was pleased to see they had an option for fruit and a half sandwich.
42469		Coleslaw was very warm.
42470		But bell service and house keeping was good.
42471		Unfortunately,  the reservation was lost.
42472		I had an incompetent Orthopedic doc (military hospitals!)
42473		Don't buy the generic items because it doesn't taste like the name brand( I bought the generic teddy cookies and it was horrible!).
42474		The lady that worked inside the bathroom was wiping it down pretty often.
42475		The  soda machine was down and she offered to go to the bar, twice and she checked on us to ensure everything was good.
42476		The manager I spoke with was one of the nicest most professional people I have spoken to, I do have to say.
42477		*******Wish it had a small area with tables to sit and eat, (like some other locations)
42478		But separate from the actual courses, I would have been content with the bread and chocolate cart alone!
42479		The meat was cut well but that's pretty much impossible to mess up.
42480		Before exiting, the band had to get their stuff off of the stage, it had been a few minutes after the incident that the band had been on stage, so when the crowd witnessed one of the Pop Unknown guys get on stage to start grabbing his gear they all went nuts, everyone started screaming in applause for all of the excitement.
42481		When prices are resort-level highs, you lose some of the authenticity which I hate seeing with Lawry's.
42482		If you like to shop local, buy local eggs, local (free range) meat, then shop here!
42483		I contacted our insurance and they did pay their portion.
42484		"Wait staff was welcoming and unbelievably 
professional."
42485		The good: Promptly took my call, scheduled an appointment and arrived on time.
42486		I was very satisfied with the experience while I had the car, and was happy upon my return that I did not hit any traffic and that the vehicle return would be on time.
42487		Considering the crowd, the hotel did ok and managed this well.
42488		The weekend manager, a male, was receptive.
42489		The Butcher's Pantry thinks it's a butcher shop - and it is a fantastic one - but more importantly, The Butcher's Pantry is beginning to realize that there is a definite need in Solon for great, locally owned restaurants and is quickly becoming one of them!
42490		I first came here with a group friends and we all had our fill of undecorated drink and merriment.
42491		Alas, neither she nor I were able to find a new pair in my size.
42492		"PLUS.. within 30 minutes after my oil change i had gone to Wilhelm for some maintenance engine work and they found nothing wrong (and the work they did could NEVER have been discovered doing an oil change)

I found myself telling the guy (nicely) i wasn't happy with my last visit and I'd never darken their doorstep again even after I'd bought two cars there."
42493		Without exaggerating we killed at least 30 bugs and spanning from all sorts.
42494		I've seen my mom get makeup done before, and she's usually always over-done.
42495		Most importantly, treat your customers with respect!!
42496		Decided to not go to my car dealer anymore for my oil change because they took too long.
42497		Every time I have been there I compared prices with several other tire shops and they are always the cheapest.
42498		The staff does not mind that sat here forever.
42499		Bring back the quality and employees from before!
42500		The questions isn't should I go, it's why aren't I there yet!
42501		We have been to a similar establishment in Savannah and it was a tightly run ship which we will visit again on our next trip.
42502		The only thing I would have skipped was dessert- the dried out and flavorless cheesecake was a bit of a shock after all the amazing food we had eaten.
42503		I checked with other companies and ultimately decided to go with Noble because of their reviews.
42504		Would not recommend many other great places of the same concept, just have to travel about 15 min west of the location of this place.
42505		Decided to give this place a try due to all of the positive reviews.
42506		That pear sparkling sake got the best of me...
42507		I walked around and saw that the Bentley trike was something new and I was interested in purchasing it.
42508		Very clean store.
42509		BOMB AF!
42510		I almost fainted when I saw that one bowl of soup was almost $70!
42511		I have never been offered with unnecessary work.
42512		I attempted to go to this store twice but they were closed.
42513		The coconut rice is gummy.
42514		We left tip not because it was customary but because our service was more than what we expected.
42515		"It is in a mall of restaurants and parking was a ...""breeze""...(get it?)..."
42516		Which was good because they got rid of the combos anyways.
42517		Nice if you want to stay away from the rug rats at the main pool.
42518		"When I ordered the seafood pancake with some friends, I pretty much inhaled it all and was left saying, ""I'm sorry, did you want some?"""
42519		"Paid for a 12"", got a 6""."
42520		if your looking to rent from bennett...stop now!!!!!!!!
42521		If you are looking to score credit cards, room keys, a couple of laptops, and even a bag of dirty underwear, the darkened unmonitored premises of the St. Tropez hotel is the place for you!
42522		My guess is that she threw it away based on the amount of tip that was left due to her wonderfully award winning customer service!!!
42523		She issued me a refund with no problem.
42524		The ice cream and the food was pretty good.
42525		But, we decided to give it a chance.
42526		We sampled the papaya salad, which was decent.
42527		We had experienced a pipe leak several years ago and it was not a pleasant experience.
42528		They serve these huge crab legs that are already split and cracked so you don't have to spend an hour trying to suck a little piece of meat out of the shell.
42529		Pizza was $7.75 each and the Emiliana salad was $7.50.
42530		The one thing I will say is that the staff has been extremely nice.
42531		I hate those overpriced prix fixe bullshit menus with their $100pp multi-course fiesta that always turns into poor quality and sloppy.
42532		The bill for all of this food, soda and hot tea was less than $20 so I gave Russell a generous tip since I think he gave us about double the food we were actually charged for.
42533		After his rude comebacks he took the right micro fiber towel to me car.
42534		I've never seen an issue on either side with violence or anything of that matter.
42535		The plusses are the facility is great for kids 11 and under.
42536		She was awesome, personally oversaw the treason from beginning to end.
42537		Parking was so easy, too easy in fact.
42538		Scarey!
42539		He also put words in my mouth and made a scene.
42540		That's okay because I practically cry every time I go back...and I don't think I could handle much more.
42541		I will be returning for all my auto service.
42542		I had to go through my home warranty, and the first company I was set up with for my  emergency claim would not return a single call.
42543		I did have an issue getting pictures done there.
42544		I had an appointment for a pre surgery appointment a few months ago and was happy to see the girl who always draws my blood was there and as it would turn out she did my chest X-ray and heart monitor thing.
42545		This was my first Chop't experience.
42546		I have been there several times and have yet to see any of the guys smile.
42547		If you need a tooth pulled, come to Kultura: their sushi pizza is bound to pull out a few for you and then some.
42548		Although the restaurant in 3/4 empty, he tells me to go back up front by the sign and he will seat me.
42549		Even though they messed up the order.
42550		Gosh darn scorpions, I am looking forward to going to sleep without doing the walk of death every night.
42551		I'm sure I'll play here again as it's one of my favorite local courses but I hope they take better care of it soon.
42552		outrageous!!
42553		"Here's a common sense tip for the employees: watch the line and as you see you're running out of toppings, set them out for like 15 minutes instead of taking it straight from the cooler to the line so that it doesn't make the ""hot"" food cold."
42554		Gets up wearing gloves & asks what I want without going to change his gloves.
42555		My boyfriend and I have heard great things about the food at this place and decided to try it out.
42556		"""Service By Committee"" was ineffective and heavy handed."
42557		As we devoured the delightful visions we'd never seen before with our rapacious, prepubescent eyes, we knew we had to get the hell out of there soon because surely this was too good to be true and some freak was going to pounce on us any minute.
42558		(Bottomless mimosas!)
42559		We waited about an hour, and with all the hype we thought it would be worth the wait.
42560		Pete was my sales guy, nice enough.
42561		If you can't do it right the first time, why would I let you try again?
42562		The only downside to this place is the parking.
42563		(I will say that the people that performed the actual wedding ceremony were very nice).
42564		Service was great.
42565		It's really not that hard.
42566		He's annoyed with me but at this point I didn't care.
42567		I figured Yum Yum would be the best pick of the two because it wasn't fast food.
42568		Thanks dude, my manicure looks great with a bandaid.
42569		Before this, I'd frequent AMC theatre at Town Square because their facilities were clean and comfortable.
42570		The ribs were so tender and fell of the bone!
42571		I called back again, spoke with her and scheduled a time for them to come paint.
42572		Whenever I go in there, they are always cleaning when they are not busy.
42573		My first trip I had the bacon carmel toffee, this was sweet meets slightly salty, not an overwhelming bacon flavor.
42574		How hard is it to get 3 flavors and the color of a cake right?
42575		Unfortunately, we discovered this at about 1:30PM on a Sunday.
42576		Ending on a bright note, I hear they have good happy hour...
42577		then the room they switched us out.. people were still occupying it!!
42578		If that is not your thing and you need a $tarbucks atmosphere you should probably pass.
42579		This place is way better!
42580		Thank you Crystal
42581		I'm leaving that office a 5 star review!
42582		I used to live here and would visit this counter all the time and never had an issue.
42583		Our second visit was for my birthday, meal service was starting off great.
42584		There's not a whole lot to say about this place other than the fact that you should already be eating there.
42585		U can tell local owners and care about putting out good local grinds.
42586		Doozy of a Deal was nice and gave me a refund.
42587		Only one bad thing is the wait.
42588		The downfall is that because this is a retirement community location, there are usually only 2 employees working in the evenings after 7pm to close, which is quite early at 11pm when others are open much later or 24 hours.
42589		"First, the lamp chop lollipops are""The Bomb""."
42590		They CHASED us out!
42591		We purchased a new home and were not pleased at all with the vegetation and yard.
42592		Room service made up bed without a fitted sheet.
42593		It is obvious that customer service is a priority here.
42594		Go to Franks or go to Olgas on Baseline in this area.
42595		He even came to my house to euthanize my previous baby so that she could just fall asleep in her bed with her family holding her.
42596		Gotta give this place props where props are due.
42597		My rim was bent a little.
42598		Well I was very excited and thought how cute/charming on the outside the restaurant looked.
42599		it was a little scary at first because the show was located at the sleazy Hooters Hotel and we were the first to show up 15mins before the show.
42600		We were SO over this dinner we grabbed our last beers and went out side.
42601		I decided I would go back and try them again today thinking they got their act together since the last time.
42602		I went because there was an Awesome price on a Hummer.
42603		The only thing they could have left off the dish was the dried basil....in my opinion it added nothing!!
42604		We ordered lunch for an office of 8, using the delivery service.
42605		Thought I could make it through the 1/2 pound burger but the fries were too good to put aside.
42606		Don't waste your time or money going anywhere else!
42607		I use to go to FirstWatch once a week....and enjoyed it.
42608		I will say though that they were pretty nice.
42609		Fighting the urge to come back tomorrow to be honest.
42610		One of the big issues with gluten free pizza is that sometimes the edges get burnt and the rest of the crust is at best underdone.
42611		They are right around the corner from my house so it's very convenient.
42612		I know I'm going to sound like a I have an axe to grind but let me tell you my story.
42613		HOOD RAT, HOOD RAT, HOOCHIE MAMA!
42614		I am a medium rare guy and was at first disappointed when they said medium was a low as they could go.
42615		My friends joke that the dentist office is my happy place!
42616		It was pretty packed but the place filled of smoke.
42617		I wish I was one of the people who had a great experience.
42618		Good deal!
42619		The only issue here is that they use a Wheat batter for pancakes and waffles.
42620		I've always enjoyed eating at Red Robin.
42621		The bar was beautiful with a backlit wine rack and irregularly shaped hide light fixtures.
42622		I couldn't believe my eyes.
42623		My only complaint would be the cost of parts, and the poor design.
42624		So,I was excited to try this place.
42625		This rude employee recommend us a game.
42626		Seeing nothing amiss, she steps back, crosses her arms and watches the rest of our transaction practically breathing down our necks.
42627		Can get loud if crowded.
42628		You can be on your phone and not even look at me and be rude.
42629		Needless to say I was infuriated!
42630		"Shirley said, actually rather snidely, ""well, as soon as she gets here then I can get you,"" and invited me to go to the atrium (out of site of the main entrance) to wait."
42631		This town needs an enema!!
42632		That is, you're not going to find maple syrup, bacon and game meat in every menu description.
42633		Panda Express serves even better meats.
42634		It seems like nothing has done to my car even the vacuuming.
42635		Adios outback
42636		She did mention I was doing good for my first time because I was on a high setting than usual for most.
42637		Forty minutes later was delivered a well done hamburger.
42638		My only complaint, is that the potatos that I was so excited about, were unfortunately burned while the staff was making them in the kitchen.
42639		In December, I was going through the process of a BK and called around to Findlay Toyota and Findlay Honda, who would not work with me until the BK was discharged and even then it was slim guarantee.
42640		Thankfully, he left our children with their meals.
42641		They have a small parking lot.
42642		I've been to many salons in Vegas with every experience being terrible so I'm very cautious and picky.
42643		It's the guys serviced for us...
42644		Moving from CA finding good pizza, nearly impossible.
42645		I started at a bikram studio, of which I quickly grew bored due to the lack of variety.
42646		It was served with a bowl of pinto beans.
42647		I understand add-on sales, etc.... but this place pushes the BIG upsell and won't give up!
42648		There are always mangers on the floor asking if you need any help.
42649		Time after time at every dealership I went to the service was not up to par and I often felt disrespected.
42650		There are some positives of this Planet Fitness.
42651		The cool things were the mechanical bull & the western saddle bar seats.
42652		Because if not Walgreens will have too much of a supply and will lose money.
42653		Anyway my dad also goes to Helvig and my dad paid cash for the visit and when his insurance paid for the visit Helvig refunded dads money back!
42654		:)  Good luck.
42655		The relaxation room has fruit infused waters and is dark and just makes you want to lie down and take a nap.
42656		He told me that's what they do it now.
42657		Nasty food!
42658		ever heard of a smile, ladies?
42659		I have been here for lunch several times, and it is a good value.
42660		Rudeness gets elevated almost to an art form back there.
42661		Tvs are in view from pretty much any table, booth, or seat at the bar.
42662		The breads are good.
42663		I will be sending my car back to these guys for as long as I own it.
42664		"Confit d'Esturgeon
This was a bit of a disappointment."
42665		I think it would better with a crunchy batter.
42666		There is no shade and you're sweating from.
42667		Plenry of delicious pizza options in town, there's just no reason to suffer at rhe hands of this place.
42668		As soon as we got there it was only a few minutes before our waitress came and got our drink orders.
42669		We actually expected to see higher prices.
42670		But all it all this place is SOLID.
42671		All of this was accompanied with a nice and inexpensive bottle of white wine which was served and presented as if it was a $300 bottle.
42672		Shitty Shitty Shitty.
42673		A few minutes later I was practically running down the isles looking for anything I could use in my new house, store credit card in my hand, I was a bit manic because it looked as though absolutely everything in the store was marked down anywhere between 30 and 60 percent or more!
42674		We ordered the Hainan chicken rice and curry chicken.. As we thought we couldnt go wrong with these.
42675		If you have the opportunity to have Aetna as your insurance provider...RUN!
42676		I'll start out with the good points:  The chicken was moist and they had ketchup.
42677		"Waiter: "" better late than never""."
42678		I don't think I've had that good of sandwich before.
42679		My HID headlight went out in my Lexus and the dealer quoted me $300 (YIKES!!!)
42680		Our waitress went missing for a while, despite the fact we told her we needed to leave at a certain time to get to a show.
42681		I do have to say the food was good though.
42682		We would have ordered more if we could eat more.
42683		I will definitely be going back for any other cell phone issues.
42684		Before you read any of this, please know that the staff members there are pretty awesome.
42685		I've never had a hotel deny me a pillow.
42686		I felt wonderful.
42687		I was scheduled to fly out of CLT and my flight was cancelled, so I wasn't exactly in the best of spirits when I arrived.
42688		Before ordering, I looked at all the reviews and I was doubtful.
42689		- I wouldn't recommend it for big parties unless you organized it with the place ahead of time.
42690		I will say the Butcher has a reason to be Arrogant.
42691		The display of food on your plate actually looks like something you would get in an expensive restaurant.
42692		We had great service and food last Saturday night.
42693		Not going to send them back again.
42694		Wow okay, can't wait to come back here with your attitude.
42695		Let me first off say that I love Children Place as a brand, they usually have budget friendly prices and stylish clothing.
42696		The whole place is old school in their approach.
42697		There are sauces you can get to soak your sandwich in to make it edible.
42698		It was another brand new Nissan next to me.
42699		He then served her with SIX additional drinks without her asking.
42700		Came here a couple times thought it was decent.
42701		I mean not just 1 book, but about 8 huge designer books loaded with samples.
42702		They also just gave us the stone wall.
42703		I went to the great clips on buffalo Vegas and they fixed it for me.
42704		She was very apologetic and the tone in her voice reflected that.
42705		Convenient, cool decor, good happy hour.
42706		Damn strait you don't; I've learned to keep my mouth shut most of the time and never mess with people that handle my food, but I came close that morning!
42707		Still,the service, and having desert and coffee on the Terrace afterwards, with a front row view of the fabulous fountain show more than made up for it.
42708		"Two will have the family screaming ""LOOOOOK  OUT""  as you almost hit not one but two moving cars before winding your way through the parking lot and on out to Frank Lloyd Wright."
42709		The bathroom had a whirlpool tub - very nice indeed.
42710		Eventually someone shows up and we get our drink order in.
42711		Will definitely return and maybe check out their other services (waxing & facials).
42712		We ate at Gilda's the previous night for much, much more, that was good, but not near the level of Smashed Pig.
42713		"We went during happy hour so all the ""sharing"" portions were 2 for 1 as well as their cocktails."
42714		My co-worker really appreciated a coupon offer also .
42715		Order at your own risk.
42716		The radiator was fine, it wasn't leaking at all.
42717		only negative thing I can think of is they don't serve bacon at all.
42718		but rather a good salad.
42719		Definitely going back to try everything else from the menu.
42720		The wings are good.
42721		I was excited about a field of food trucks.
42722		I kind of thought this had to be a scam, really.
42723		There was no shortage of blueberries either which is often a problem I experience with muffins.
42724		They have a big parking lot in the strip area.
42725		So we ended walking all the way back to Harrah's and had a great time there.
42726		Food gets delivery 1.5 hours after I made an order.
42727		The lines can be really really long if you go during normal meal times.
42728		I wish it would have been a little fresher.
42729		If you need more groceries then I would suggest you go to the bigger store as you can get more yummy Arabic goodies!
42730		He was nice, gave us some free samples to use while we are waiting for our medicine that should come from the mail.
42731		It felt like a never ending hike that took us about 4 hours!
42732		I spoke to a polite woman who told me there would be no problem with a change, we could move the pick-up time back fifteen minutes to 12:35PM.
42733		These guys are CROOKS.
42734		Step it up FedEx.
42735		Right is looking jacked up!
42736		"If they hadn't put the ""Brunch Special Menu"" in front of me I'd have ordered the California Burger - it's a home-run itself - a half pound over-sized burger big enough to split made with with Monterrey Jack Cheese, Thick Cut (ask for well) done bacon, fresh made Guacamole, Red Onion and some kind of special sauce BUT WAIT on the Specials Menu was this  Breakfast Burger that had about a dozen interesting ingredients that I can't even recall beyond greens, a sunny side egg, grilled veggies and it was open face on toast."
42737		I've had better bone marrow & the Rocky Mountain oysters would be better with a better dipping sauce...maybe a lemon based aioli.
42738		Fast service and a call back on Memorial Day, the same day I called!
42739		been in USA for 5 yrs have tried lots of Indian restaurants but the taste was somewhat 'okay', neither satisfied and no complaints.
42740		The tickets for a Senior afternoon movie are a dollar more than other Harkins theaters.
42741		I honetly havent enjoyed AYCE till i tried theres.
42742		Paid nothing as advertised and received 2 drink coupons which was a nice, non-advertised bonus.
42743		Luckily I still had the sampler at the table, which was a slightly cloudy pale ale, and my new beer was a rich toned amber.
42744		We returned the car at the end of the week no problems.
42745		First a last time I take my car there.
42746		This monster sandwich was a beast.
42747		yeah this is the response... so I have to explain them again, look at the contract.
42748		I overheard a few people say they would never stay at the Westin again because of the parking situation.
42749		These days, I've almost come to expect horrendous customer service from any medical staff.
42750		This restaurant could easily hold it's own in Shadyside or Squirrel Hill but instead it is in Irwin, Wow!
42751		Gets crowded during peek hours.
42752		The dessert is nothing to write home about.
42753		The stars were mac n cheese and onion rings.
42754		I was a bit skeptical about returning here after I used to frequent the diamond China restaurant until their standards fell.
42755		Was disappointed at this but honestly, I wouldn't have expected anything else because it was so close to closing.
42756		But why order something that can easily (and less expensively) be done at home?
42757		The GM was serving people at the speed of snail.
42758		The description says it's 1/2 coffee shop, 1/2 wine bar but it's so much more.
42759		The shop I used in Scottsdale also does an inspection for free because they care about their customers.
42760		OM NOM FRIGGIN NOM!!!!
42761		If all of these things and more sound irresistible to you as the vulnerable, walking money bag that you are to ASU, then Vista Del Sol is the place for you!
42762		There had to be at least 20 tiny sweets options and again we were allowed to select as many as our hearts (and stomachs) desired.
42763		He defended the guy who came out and said yes maybe she tip she get better job this is america everything costs money.
42764		Congrats, Buford Kitchen, for being my restaurant of choice if I had to make a recommendation to my worst enemy.
42765		Do the sound of sporadic fire alarms at 5 a.m. and the lively discussions of your neighbors through paper-thin walls delight you?
42766		Home Depot on Indian Bend, Tatum Blvd and on frank Lloyd blvd are the best.
42767		I was then told that because I ate there the previous night that they comped my dessert which was awesome.
42768		he even told us don't drink too much of the soup since it's not homemade soup, and that there's msg in it obviously.
42769		The line is out the door every time I go and occassionally there is a 10-20 min wait.
42770		He came over.
42771		Not over done but BLACK.
42772		FEES, FEES, AND MORE FEES!
42773		Thanks a lot for nothing!
42774		I am no fan of clothes shopping.
42775		My husbands steak was medium well and he ordered medium rare.
42776		Overall I liked the regular pizza better.
42777		I had been trying to buy a home for 2 1/2 years, put in multiple offers with different agents and lost them all due to their lack of follow up!
42778		She greeted customers by holding the scanner toward them without even looking.
42779		It's still a great place to meet friends for a drink before a game.
42780		Our waitress was really nice and we felt bad for her.
42781		But it's Sunday Dim Sum and you're in the restaurant business for how long now...this shouldn't be a complete surprise.
42782		3) burger came with untoasted fridge cold buns.
42783		and the nail polish started coming of right away.
42784		"Should've said ""oh I'm sorry, let me make that for you now"".. she's an excellent example of customer service!"
42785		Anne needs to get some reading spectacles.
42786		Too bad they don't offer Coke Zero instead of Pepsi products.
42787		Food looked excellent and delicious, though we didn't enjoy anything but coffee drinks.
42788		Mondays are hard.
42789		(With attitude) I explained EXACTLY what Jacob looked like for clarification.
42790		You'll never be able to eat a regular, factory made, chain restaurant donut again.
42791		My truck had been shuddering and shaking badly at certain RPMs & speeds.
42792		Run by this place and don't look back.
42793		Our tour leader was fun and friendly!
42794		It is rare to get good customer service here.
42795		I went to Good Works Auto Repair with a Groupon for an oil change and also purchased an air filter and cabin filter for my vehicle.
42796		Now that the buzz (pun totally intended) is that eating local honey helps with allergies, why not incorporate it into my every day diet??
42797		Lick the bowl good.
42798		Robert is a great salesman who's only concern is making sure you are in the bed you want, not just trying to sell you the most expensive thing in the store.
42799		I did order a side of the buttered peas to go along with my plate and they were great (but you can't really go wrong with making peas).
42800		If you live around Rainbow blvd, Take the drive to Spring Mountain Rd for REAL Church's chicken!
42801		), and the prices are always at least 1k over bluebook.
42802		I bought the #9 pastrami and provologne but after the pastrami she put turkey instead of provologne.
42803		The hot fudge shake was good and I also liked their fries.
42804		This was okay!
42805		I don't care what excuse you have, that should never be forgotten.
42806		Ahhhh this place... Can you guys add more staff please?
42807		My only minor issue: the stock can be inconsistent sometimes.
42808		Try the Clevelander, you WILL thank me!
42809		Thinking maybe it was me, I forked a mouthful of shrimp, onion and green pepper into my wife's mouth and watched as her eyes got big.
42810		Our coffee was constantly topped off and the waitress was very attentive without being annoying.
42811		I was really starting to miss it.
42812		The manager was even rude when we complained.
42813		Standard car dealership tactics but it's a little intimidating for someone to walk up and there are about 5 dudes waiting to pounce.
42814		"Not this girl...I'd been admiring BR's work for years when they used to exhibit at the Spring Green art fair, so the very next morning after saying ""yes"" we called from California to book our appointment with BR upon on return."
42815		At that point, we were already a bit upset but managed to keep our cool.
42816		I usually have pretty good timing, however I have had to wait over an hour & even run some errands & come back.
42817		It's just convenient.
42818		Our room was right near the elevator so as soon as someone gets out of the elevator you can see directly into our room.
42819		Greatly appreciated.
42820		"Your the one 30 yrs old and washing cars
For living!"
42821		If I lived on the Strip, this bar would be my regular spot.
42822		Middle finger bro!
42823		One thing that bothers me though is they always try to push their Macy's card.
42824		Authentic Japanese food is what Toronto is lacking!
42825		I couldn't even finish it all so I took the rest home.
42826		"I'm 5'2"" and it seems clothing makers think everyone is over 5'4""!"
42827		The food had a please take presentation.
42828		The gnocchi was simply suburb as was the pizza with truffles.
42829		The skinny margarita was marginal.
42830		I just want to cry knowing I'll never have another hazelnut macchiato.
42831		I will start off by saying the optometrists was great.
42832		Thank you for getting the stuck ball out of the machine for him as well.
42833		They got rid of a lot of stuff that was really good and added a lot of fillers mainly flat breads and sliders.
42834		I will say that the location is great and close to everything.
42835		Well after weeks of waiting for them to deliver at my new address no one showed up, I would even see the sparklettes guy come but would never drop off water so I called again and waited and again no water delivered, so I finally closed my account and the next time I saw the sparklettes guy I drive up I flagged him down told them I canceled my services and took the cooler I was renting, so bam I thought everything was done.
42836		After going on the AZ DMV site to look up what is needed (the site gets a negative 1 star btw) I was thinking it was going to be a nightmare at the DMV.
42837		I didn't care for the batter it was too doughy.
42838		I ordered a week later giving them a very courteous 2nd chance hoping that it may have just been an off day when I initially ordered, plus my usual spot was closed for the night.
42839		THEY WILL SCREW YOU OVER BIG TIME!!!
42840		Vista Del Sol is a hot mess to say the least.
42841		With everywhere closed Sunday, and having to be out of the house by midnight on Monday, I began to feel extremely stressed.
42842		Luckily, it was pretty cheap.
42843		My dog has always been given a bowl of water, on top of that Iv yet to have had bad service.
42844		They let us check I early at no cost.
42845		To get the reservation was a feat in itself.
42846		Anywhere but here.
42847		Of the fries, the eggplant were better to my taste although the zucchini were good, too.
42848		"As the Kool-Aid Man famously yells, ""Ohhhh, Yeeaaahhhh!"""
42849		I forgot what my husband ordered but he was completely statisfied.
42850		If you are looking for a great wine selection or cheese plates them this is not your place.
42851		I was highly recommended to a great realtor that honestly did a fantastic job for me.
42852		The burgers taste gamey.
42853		My only issue was that the chutney served with the apps was too thin.
42854		This joint deserves support of a blind faith try.
42855		If you have a kid who likes LEGO but you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a handful of pieces, come here for large misc bags for $20 or a pick-n-mix selection starting at something like $5 for a salad bowl container.
42856		SLOWEST ELEVATORS ON THE PLANET.
42857		Try Western Dry Cleaners in Goodyear - great family owned place, honest and friendly!
42858		This is an update regarding GM/Cadillac --- Since my last update I've sold both of my Cadillac XLR's (also known as very expensive paperweights, due to GM/Cadillac's decision to stop making replacement parts for the XLR).
42859		They also have some packaged goods that seem a little on the expensive side.
42860		BOHO FURNITURE AND STEPHANIE ARE THIEVES!
42861		You've been warned!
42862		Just a word a caution Yelpers: the two baked goods mentioned above sell like hot cakes.
42863		Better food and just as cheap.
42864		There are a dozen other things on the menus I wanted to try.
42865		How could they not notice?
42866		My meal started with my waiter bringing me a warm beer.
42867		I could die eating the gnocchi and chicken (the $17 dish).
42868		Their food had always been tasty, plentiful and consistent.
42869		Flies on the food.
42870		I assumed since I was paying by the hour, that they would try to squeeze out every minute, but they literally ran to and from the truck.
42871		Really reminded me of being in a classic New York eatery.
42872		The only thing I didn't like was that if you wear a jacket you have to check it for 2.50.
42873		I wasn't able to have more than a bite and that enough.
42874		Yelp has this place all wrong - I would give it more stars if I could!
42875		Lots of waitresses and waiters standing around.
42876		From the moment I  walked in,15 minutes late, I was thanked for choosing to patronize their salon.
42877		It seemed like she had a magic button on the glass or something.
42878		When I walked in I honestly couldn't decide what I wanted cuz again I'm not about bagels at all.
42879		However, I've read a couple of accounts which described inattentive service.
42880		But it turns out there is an easier way.
42881		2015 - decent experience.
42882		Normally, I would walk out due to the arrogance of the manager, but I am hungry, tired, and have little time, so I take the seat where I am directed, order.
42883		My car was driving very roughly.
42884		They also said obviously OfficeMax doesn't trust its employees and they have too much time on their hands to look at the content of the documents.
42885		Have been for filet mignon three times and just oohed and awwwd every time.
42886		I was so Mad!
42887		We have ate here on several occasions and referred many friends.
42888		We have been about 3 times and have had fabulous food and wonderful service each time.
42889		The spot also gave us a front row seat to all the server's bickering.
42890		The meal started off great with some awesome jalapeno hummus and puffy table bread for appetizer.
42891		Bought clear heels from this store.Needed them for my girlfriends wedding due to her choice of bridesmaids dress color baby blue...wore shoes for 2 hours and lining of shoes came unglued,luckyly I brought an extra outfit and shoes to change into!
42892		He had a personal tragedy that weekend and was unable to work, but his replacement was terrible.
42893		I will be sending this to corporate hopefully they can use this as a training tool or to relieve some inept managers from their duties.
42894		We asked at the help desk & they found a 2nd one stocked elsewhere, yes!!
42895		The wait staff is the definition of customer service (Amanda was my server).
42896		And I'm sure if I wanted to add something to my order, that would be justtttt fine.
42897		Scrumptious!!
42898		It did, however offer up a fun variety of cougars and possums, though!
42899		So far I'm glad I did.
42900		It's a little awkward to not be able to see a menu until it's your turn to order if others are in line behind you.
42901		The stew comes along with fries literately!
42902		If you want red carpet service call these guys.
42903		I feel like any place I move will be a downgrade from this place!
42904		The picture in the menu looked so yummy.
42905		They give you the cup with the soft-serve ice cream in it, and you go over to the pop machine and add as much as you want.
42906		I now have called VCA Black mountain and they welcomed me with a free office visit and said they will look at my dog and see what they can do for him and he may need an xray.
42907		Wonderful (again, sarcasm).
42908		However, they were very personable.
42909		"This is the woman who is accused of being too ""stoned"" to cook pizza."
42910		(I hate when I go to salons and they try to nail you with tons of $$$ products).
42911		Scary place.
42912		They had these wedges of chocolate goodness sitting in the case that kept trying to get my attention.
42913		Generally, I don't mind affordable options that are somewhat close to my business destination.
42914		They would have charged me for the services if I left, so I decided to stay.
42915		Conversely, we used Lowes (Frank Lloyd Wright - Sonia) for our bathrooms and they were excellent.
42916		He didn't spend anytime with us asking about our night but he took the time to build rapport with the two groups behind us.
42917		Regardless of that, the food is delicious.
42918		My buddy wound up getting some tickets through a rewards program at work, so technically they didn't cost us anything out of pocket.
42919		Was unapologetic and offered the 9 of us to sit at the bar for dinner!
42920		I think with a little more networking and advertisements this place could go a LONG WAY!!
42921		Planned on Sunday morning brunch and was ready to have to wait to be seated but that wasn't the case.
42922		The mini donuts were cute!
42923		We were too full to try dessert but the ones we saw being serve to our neighboring tables looked good.
42924		So I was slightly impressed.
42925		We didn't bother to complain,  First thing in the morning we used our lap top and the wi-fi to reserve a room in a nice place for the balance of our stay and checked out.
42926		Did a very good job of remodeling the place and the service is very good.
42927		I glanced one look down the dress and up at the full length mirror and just sobbed.
42928		When I got the bill to pay the Manager of course he ACCEPTED MY PAYMENT without asking how everything was even though he clearly seen half our meal was not eaten with empty drink cups.
42929		Just make sure you warn any skittish guests that the gazebo is right next to the party pool, and even though they will turn down the music a bit, you will still be able to hear hooting and hollering, and the latest obnoxious radio hits.
42930		Next time I'm going to let Linda  do whatever she wants to my eyebrows.
42931		Although the restaurant is set to close in just one day, the reason why is very obvious.
42932		The food is usually pretty good, especially their fried rice and noodles.
42933		Not surprised since it's Las Vegas, especially downtown, but there's some sketchy people around here too, just stay aware what's around you.
42934		The pricing is cheap compared to the amount of food you get.
42935		All I can say is OMG!
42936		Truly, a class act one would generally expect from an establishment as well known as the Hilton corporation.
42937		The eggs tasted like they were just picked from a farm!
42938		My only critique is that their fish tank is in need of some TLC.
42939		He wouldn't give up at no either.
42940		In addition, I requested to add tuna sashimi.
42941		Thats strike 3.
42942		A backyard outlet had live wires exposed to the outdoor elements and was fraying badly.
42943		We were freezing!
42944		"We went with the ribs (Delish)
They fell right off the bones!mmmm mm!"
42945		"But I didn't trust them( see my full review on Active)
A lady answered the phone and told me to bring my van in to see if I really needed new calipers."
42946		Side dishes are quite pricey.
42947		Unfortunately this place has closed down.
42948		There is minimal shade so I recommend hats and sunscreen.
42949		The best part of staying at this hotel was the bistro/ bar area.
42950		Never any issues in the morning with this location.
42951		This is the second Fran's I've seen with Modern decor- I love it.
42952		"He had the scooter apart in under and hour, put the petcock in the right position and returned all the ""we don't know where these go"" gaskets in THE CORRECT PLACE."
42953		"The bad:
* The lobby has a pretty lame bar."
42954		But the mountain of fries has to be seen to be believed.
42955		This place is far better with more variety.
42956		Lots of parking.
42957		If you have to get rid of something, no matter trade in value, this is the place.
42958		His is a small-ish shop but I will definitely come to his first before I'll patronize a big company that only gives mediocre customer service.
42959		If your on Clifton looking for some good Asian food, get on Madison in Lakewood, and head to the Thai Kitchen, a few bucks more, however, everything is cooked to perfection......
42960		No one I know has ever heard of anything so outrageous.
42961		So he take his sweet time to bring all our refills and sides of ranch.
42962		Thanks my whole review, fuck you yelp for not letting me post it because it's too short.
42963		I get that your job may not be the most exciting but it is your job to seat people so I don't expect attitude.
42964		This is the kind of neighborhood where people do not like to spend money if they don't get value for it so it was promising.
42965		After suffering a bizarre injury to my neck, I was unable to sit down without losing feeling in my arm.
42966		It's more like a place for animals, that's the environment that is created here.
42967		Also, it would have been nice to know that hot dogs would come charred (which I ordered for kids), given the lack of a kids menu (unless there was one I missed).
42968		Tiny spot.
42969		We will not do business here again, because online customers are more important than repeat customers that actually desire to do an in-person purchase...
42970		"Actually, this is THE place to go in the ""hood"" for cheap drinks."
42971		Kinda expensive and I don't taste a difference but if its your thing its there.
42972		The egg rolls were soft.
42973		My name is Amanda, and I have a problem.
42974		I literally have never waited more than 10 minutes in the waiting room.
42975		AWWWW..I was so happy the first time...my car was AWESOME!
42976		First, is it necessary to have the seats be actual racing bike seats?
42977		He WAS a excellent Doctor in the beginning you never had to wait, the place was clean and the office staff was friendly.
42978		But the Rewards Center treats me like I'm a high roller.
42979		No wonder these guys have won ethics awards.
42980		It was warm in there also as if the air conditioning was just turned on.
42981		Only $3 for domestic and $3.50 for imports.
42982		one morning we arrived at the end of the 6:00 am-10:00 am daily serving time and the fresh fruit was gone.
42983		Great service, delicious food & at a price point that was reasonable.
42984		I should have paid him extra for doubling as a therapist.
42985		That is why I travel almost an hour to go to this location.
42986		I went today at 3:30pm and got charged for dinner.
42987		No soap in the bathroom.
42988		Egg was cooked perfectly.
42989		**Do not come here if you're tight on time!
42990		I expected them to shampoo the seats because of their stupidity but I'm just glad I got out of there alive with no scratches or damage to my truck.
42991		I've only heard positive things about the Chef of Jennifer's.
42992		Forget thai express!
42993		After all that they still had the balls to give us the bill!
42994		"We always ate here one while visiting from SoCal The crab buffet  ended a few years ago but we happened to be in town and noticed the buffet had crab on Friday night so we went
We waited for 1.5 hours in line started shortly after 7 pm."
42995		I wanted to know what the commotion was about, I ordered a Connecticut Roll, which is warm lobster and Butter, waited promptly 10 minutes to the best amazing perfectly cooked lobster roll!
42996		Rich is only there on weekends, so make sure you get here on Saturday or Sunday to experience $200 per person service on a $40.00 meal.
42997		We drove back home to Atlanta and pulled into Children's Scottish Rite and were immediately met with competency, that we had become accustomed to over the last 3 years.
42998		Figured we would take advantage of the happy hour drinks and grab some food.
42999		Basically, Hell's Half Acre is Westgate's very own douchebag filter.
43000		Charged me $3.25 a yard for fabric great deal!
43001		Way better for sure!
43002		I did want to try Missy because it sounded like she does a really good job.
43003		I went there several times a week and every time the same lady asked me my name.
43004		"Thank you for your attention,

Carol"
43005		I did like the dipping sauce that came with the potstickers.
43006		I am 48 years old and have been to restaurants all over the USA, and until last week have never been in any kind of restaurant that does not offer you a free cup of water with your meal.
43007		Everything went well, expect when I got a charge for smoking in a non-smoking room.
43008		We went to the Kilt which had max capacity of well over 100 people and we had two beers AND water within two minutes.
43009		fluffy and flaky and they melt on your mouth.
43010		I wasn't as impressed with the live music/entertainment as some other Yelpers.
43011		The customer service is great!
43012		I have to say, I also couldn't believe their patience with some of the customers when I was there.
43013		You know those nights when you're craving a late night boba treat after dinner or something, and you finally get your hands on a nice flavored milk tea or tea, and then life is basically ruined when that first chew of boba actually takes a bit of work?
43014		Hard to troubleshoot over FaceTime.
43015		The bread is excellent and everytime i go there its excellent.
43016		I can see why Hilton took away the franchise!
43017		Place was fairly empty but the bartender Charles was friendly and attentive.
43018		Server took drink orders and delivered them 10 minutes later-one being something we didn't order.
43019		Bought a table.
43020		"That aint ""spa treatment."""
43021		The other Verizon store that lacked Good Customer service is the one on Eastern and St. Rose.
43022		All of them could have been really greasy but they weren't.
43023		They should find john and bring him back if they want to succeed!
43024		Another note on maintenance: They just barge right in.
43025		I thought the restaurant I gave good review before this, was IT.
43026		He was on the phone while seating me.
43027		Regardless, it sets the stage for slower than normal service , just out of the size and chaos.
43028		The folks two tables down had been seated later than us, and by this point had already enjoyed their apps, drinks and tacos.
43029		I like the character of this place.
43030		I don't know how they wouldn't have known.
43031		I was excited to try this new boba spot.
43032		Luckily my friend is a bigger guy and I felt comfortable with him holding the back of my chair.
43033		She is very sweet, speaks English and easy to communicate your wants/needs with.
43034		Waitress brought a small spicy cabbage to start that came complimentary....it was the highlight of the whole meal.
43035		The bartenders really need to work with their Hensley Sales rep to make sure the bar is stocked for a weekend.
43036		Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to enjoy the weekend adult libations and fun by the pool bar.
43037		Their beef wrapped in betel leaves are yummiest.
43038		The comment made below by the owner is absolutely untrue.
43039		Huge fan of Korean BBQ.
43040		The staff is friendly, though.
43041		I've avoided it for so long because even the thought of Swenson's is painful when you have moved away from the area.
43042		"I've been to some stores closer to the strip that tend to get a ""party crowd"" coming in to pick up their supplies for the night or vagrants looking for handouts."
43043		The food is like homemade and traditional, you would feel like you're sitting in a restaurant in Delhi, not on Chandler blvd lol
43044		I was having horrible back, hip and neck pain that was significantly impacting my daily life.
43045		I hope they hurry and build a location in Calgary since according to their website they do not have one here yet.
43046		Needed something sweet to wipe that garlicky goodness from my palate.
43047		-The tomato salsa didn't have a great flavor, but I still ate it.
43048		It was very frustrating.
43049		The one negative: cocktails are overpriced and not all that creative.
43050		Thankfully she got us all home safe.
43051		"Cons: 
There were some stains at the bottom of our bed sheets that grossed us out but we got over it."
43052		We are from Wisconsin and for us there are not a lot of good pizza restaurants in Las Vegas.
43053		The salads were the best part of the meal.
43054		The calamari was pretty good.
43055		The last surgery I had somewhere else, they couldn't get the IV in and tried multiple, painful times & finally had to put it in my neck.
43056		From the street, the place looks cute.
43057		The sprouts were tasty and probably were my favorite dish of the evening.
43058		It's nice to call or text and have stuff ready and waiting to go through before I even get there in their proper sizes.
43059		Only open Monday - Friday, though, which is a bummer.
43060		It was looking pretty dingy and never sealed by Home Depot installers so the grout was looking terrible.
43061		I personally give the big black guy that delivered to us tonite 5 out of 5 stars.
43062		If you're wondering what to do with your time and money in Las Vegas, go to Baz.
43063		I saved myself $3,500 because I saw Hi-Tech Dental for what they were = SCAMMERS!!
43064		Took my truck to AAA automotive.
43065		No napkins or forks, finally brought 7 for party of 9.
43066		2 words and 2 words only: CRISPY TOFU.
43067		Now, if you visit Gastonia and don't go get a Tony's milkshake, something must be wrong with you.
43068		Only downfall are the bums that hang around there....
43069		I have never dealt with a group of advisers that actually think I should be honored for them to work on my car, this was amazing to me.
43070		I would've skipped the truffle fries, needs some type of dipping sauce in my opinion and the Brussels weren't amazing.
43071		They want you to pay an be happy no matter what.......don't go there wrong place if you want good customer  service!
43072		They weren't busy - his attitude said enough.
43073		SMFH.
43074		Dishes were brought out with timing in mind, so at no point were there more than two or three items on the table.
43075		What a pleasant surprise to come to Yelp after the fact to give a five star review only to find that so many people have already done the same.
43076		It's a shame the former shop and owner were always someone and somewhere I could bring my pet.
43077		No apologies from the wait staff at all.
43078		Nice sidestepping and not taking ownership, long-haired 80's rocker looking dude!!
43079		Last year I gave this hotel a good review.
43080		The green beans, crab puffs and chow mien were good.
43081		The hot pot is not what we thought (no crispy rice).
43082		"I don't recommend purchasing a unit here though - they simply make no $, better to just rent a night when you want it than to ""own""."
43083		Said okay and it's a nice enough neo-urban pub.
43084		Don't expect standard pasta dishes.
43085		There were only a few I didn't much care for and those were with heavy chocolate, coconut and pumpkin.
43086		The wonderful store manager there got on the phone with the warranty people and come to find out our after market warranty can only be taken care of at a Hyundai dealer... after discussing with the warranty manager about Henderson Hyundai's refusal unless we pay and their awful customer service, the he gave the ok for us to be covered at Tire works.
43087		We were in town for a wedding and tried this place out and were so sad that we can't be regulars because we live so far away in CA!
43088		Came here because of all the good reviews.
43089		If this shop were close to home, I would pay for man-pedicures on a regular basis.
43090		Prices are old school, too.
43091		Not huge, and not a lot of the salami and other things, mostly lettuce.
43092		Didnt want to deal with the strip.
43093		If all the other sushi places in Arizona are not open then I would go back.
43094		Up your game,  staff at this location.
43095		My carpets looked like 5 kids spilled juice on the floor!
43096		This was mom's favorite place until today.
43097		-There aren't that many tables here.
43098		Both times the orders came to about 25 bucks, so much less than a dollar per donut average.
43099		CRACKHEADS!
43100		They fixed it up quite nicely, and it had great potential to be a super fun spot to hang out with friends and family.
43101		this is suppossed to be a restaurant not fast food.
43102		Also, I believe that I saw somewhere on their website that you eat for free on your birthday!
43103		Last time I went in was about a year ago and the layout was very big and open like they didn't have a lot of merchandise out on the floor.
43104		The line can get a bit long sometimes.
43105		My water tastes very metallic, but I'm hoping that goes away after the new pipes clear out.
43106		My hair was super dry, careless cut can be told next day.
43107		Between those two sides, a salad and an entree, I could easily have called this my last supper and been happily content in life.
43108		The pizza comes late, ice cold.
43109		An annual pass may be better for locals.
43110		For you single women like me who know nothing about plumbing they are fair and let you know the charges as they go.
43111		Toooo much food!
43112		"When ordering the smoothie though, I asked if it was an option that many choose and the employee at the register replied with ""I mean I work here, I'm not going to say anything is bad..."" I feel that it's normal to ask what is commonly ordered."
43113		EVERY SINGLE ITEM WAS INEDIBLE.
43114		When I walk into the room it is sweltering.
43115		The seats on the plane were increibly tight.
43116		Especially as my wife did not like to iron shirts, I did a poor job, and I always wanted a crisp starched shirt.
43117		You don't even notice it's vegetarian.
43118		No substitutions so if they are out too bad.
43119		They gave me a week and a half timeline and they got the job done right on schedule.
43120		The seating can be challenging as it is limited.
43121		The bucket of beers were cheap, so we got that.
43122		This place is aweful.
43123		Try the tofu.
43124		And just because you have a few Mexicans working for you doesn't mean your not raciest.
43125		I may do more!
43126		As a younger person I often find myself being treated poorly by the older hobbyists who usually work in small establishments.
43127		MMMm!
43128		MANY flies!
43129		I was extremely furious, but given my inherent kind and calm demeanor I swallowed a globus pharingys seething with rage and resentment and slapped a smile on my face so to speak.
43130		Hope things change so il want to come back.
43131		Unfortunately for me, she recently changed her schedule.
43132		Not even a sorry.....
43133		Expectation: Excitement, aquarium looks great, menu is interesting, let's try it ....
43134		I guess the sushi bar works since you're so good and busy.
43135		Nice complex and okay location.
43136		There was a certain spice that they used that left you craving another piece.
43137		She (the first stylist), completely f'kd up my hair by cutting #1 Too short, #2 Unevenly, and #3 Not graduated.
43138		But, she defies my wishes and comes back asking for more.
43139		You can tell there was a lot of MSG.
43140		"She answered the phone by saying ""yeah?""."
43141		It's been a couple years now and each time I go my brows are back on fleek.
43142		The salon is very nice and organized, also looks clean.
43143		Smokey all the way through the bar.
43144		SO worth waiting for 5-10 minutes while popping peanuts.
43145		I never complain to the staff.
43146		We have been all over the city from one place to another in search of good Indian Food and we kept having bad experiences, or ok experiences at best.
43147		I had daily breakdowns wondering if he needed to be regimes and after seeing my old vet he went crazy and was acting completely aggressive due to terror.
43148		I went just down the street to Harvest and spent $10 on some edibles and got a preroll, some canabliss gummies and a 200mg hilly bean oil cartridge for free.
43149		They were out of everything.
43150		I recommend sitting at the bar for the full experience.
43151		We had a bad smoke smell through our new house, thanks to Nevada Ozone, it's completely gone.
43152		(RUDE) I literally live across the street.
43153		Make sure you check the expiration dates on items because they have a lot of items that are slightly past the Best Buy date but still not expired on the shelves.
43154		The hotel salon had told me I could only use the extensions they sold, which for me was a huge risk with a matching color and they wanted an unreasonable price.
43155		Lucky for them there is not another sushi place in the area or they would be out of business.
43156		Finally, the steak and onion fries were good.
43157		Now, you don't even get that!
43158		I have nothing to say against the restaurant/staff/food.
43159		But I wouldn't recommend for a girl/woman to order it unless she has a big appetite.
43160		The only (minor) issue we had was not finding enough light-weight balls.
43161		I puff it up, sit or lay in it and put my feet on my squataman and watch tv,, take a nap, eat a bowl of ice cream and just melt (no pun intended!).
43162		Love it when a place is fast food and doesn't taste like it.
43163		I called a few places but didn't feel comfortable having them work on my grandmother's clock.
43164		I had asked to also have a broken side mirror replaced and with no questions asked, told us he would have that replaced.
43165		Let me start by saying we were very excited to try this new place!
43166		Tables stayed unbussed all around us the entire visit.
43167		Cashier was moving at glacial pace which is exactly what someone wants when they need to get to work and are just trying to get something to eat.
43168		*My absolute biggest piece of advice and the reason for writing this review is to let you know about the 50% off sales they have daily (usually one week per section).
43169		Everything is an upsell.
43170		I have been to other salons and I was crammed next to another bride and wasn't even allowed to browse through their dress selection!
43171		I hope.management reads this and to the guy who was there, grow up buddy....
43172		There is nothing Mexican about melting cheddar yellow cheese with sausage and calling it queso fundido with chorizo!
43173		They've always had great food and service.
43174		I was faced with a traumatic event where my eyelash extensions was ripped out by an eyebrow waxer.
43175		Makes for a nice atmosphere but I want this place to do well so it sticks around - get out there and try it people!
43176		Molisana bakery has a way better hot table and the best pizza for sure!
43177		By the way, the pool is small and populated by a 50+ crowd.
43178		$40 for what seemed like a brand new dress.
43179		My first taste of Vegas after leaving the airport and I immediately wanted to fly back home.
43180		Will Def go back to try other items.
43181		She also kept about $30 in hair from my weave she helped herself to.
43182		Go to a wonderful guy called Curtis.
43183		Our appointment was 9am on a Saturday, once she arrived she never apologized for being late.
43184		Wishing you all good Food Karma.
43185		At least we're now here walking distance trying out a viet cafe, already a big difference w/the staff!
43186		We had been to a dealership prior to checking out Coulter that made me want to take a bath when I left, they were so slimy.
43187		I can see being pricey if you're treated well, but they take your money and act like they are doing you a favor.
43188		Never ever will I leave my items to be returned behind the counter while I shop.
43189		I usually love Hooters, good wings, good views, all of the usual reasons to go to Hooters.
43190		It was our honeymoon trip this week and we had a previous good experience at Flamingo so decided to give it another shot.
43191		Wish all service repairs went this way.
43192		Which they charged to my card without asking!
43193		How can you not handle volume at your location in the center of town?
43194		The staff here is very nice, and friendly, the office is nice and clean they tried to help.
43195		I would never receive an offer like that from a manager at Lowe's or Home Depot.
43196		We drove over here to try out the pizza and the hours everywhere say it's open.
43197		I'll preface this review by saying that Kelsey's is typically one of my favourite restaurants and I usually eat at a Kelsey's at least once every month or two, if not more frequently.
43198		Seriously, what should have been an absolutely awful and stressful experience was nothing.
43199		There is three auto part stores on Northsight, I would suggest you give Advanced an opportunity to serve you.
43200		We recently moved to this part of town and there are just too many local joints to waste time or money on a bad one.
43201		It is convenient because it's on the strip.
43202		I'm only extra patient because I worked as a server but even I have limits and this place really tested me.
43203		The second time, the concierge was lacking in skill and so we paid the cover.
43204		It is pricey (2 of us had $300 check).
43205		It started coming a part on me after a month.
43206		When I first started coming to this place I love it.
43207		I usually love coming to this store when I come to South Park mall, so this time I brought my little brother and girlfriend.
43208		First vacuum took my 4 quarters and laughed at me.
43209		I tried on the sample and loved it.
43210		BECAUSE...taste guaranteed!!
43211		I recommend anywhere else but here.
43212		When I initially visited the Stripper 101 webpage I was super excited to take the class.
43213		Just goes to show that the offices that spend all the money on the billboards aren't who you want doing your dental work.
43214		They were huge.
43215		When I first got this company for my house for cable I was very happy.
43216		A poor start to the evening, but what really set us off is this: while we waited to even be asked if we'd like to order a drink, the team captain, Kevin, helped himself to a beer right in front of us (and continued to drink throughout our visit).
43217		They happily took my money, but don't expect them to do anything else for you.
43218		I'm from back east and sadly traveling pet groomers are a rarity and the ones I've tried were awful!
43219		Had to try this place with all the great reviews.
43220		If your craving a breakfast item at 7pm this is the place to go, not feeling breakfast that's okay they have a good selection of items that are more lunch/dinner friendly.
43221		IT WAS EMBARRASSING!
43222		When conversation continued with Joey at the later date, my husband became frustrated and I decided to handle the situation with a level head.
43223		the bathrooms are huuuge!
43224		"If you live in the area, DO NOT GO TO 83 AVE AND DEER VALLEY LOCATION... ""systems are down"" ""fryers are down""  good luck getting what you want in the a.m. just pulling up you see the staff out for a ""smoke break"""
43225		My only complaint is that they don't offer regular cleaning service in my area.
43226		I was not dissaponted and neither will you be!
43227		But they must have buttered it to perfection because I could've eaten a pile of it.
43228		Why in the world would you turn down a paying customer?
43229		I brought my little sister here for her 21st birthday and thought the Flamingo Hotel would be a nice and luxurious stay for us.
43230		They were not up to par to the standards that Bevo set on the first night we came, so for our last meal in Montréal, we decided to go to Bevo again.
43231		I don't think they clean it at all.
43232		With such high ratings, I was excited to go.
43233		BEWARE:  Johnny's downtown is not as good... different chefs with slightly different recipes!!
43234		You're a FN PLUMBER!
43235		My other kids ordered the longganisa meal and that one was the most decent of all the dishes.
43236		As I'm still standing there he starts to help someone else.
43237		":( 
I was not disappointed in getting ice cream though!"
43238		Glad I ventured out to satisfy my tourists' gluttony.
43239		Almost didn't find the place because of its location inside of a community center and has no sign of its existence on the outside of the building!
43240		I went here because it was conveniently close to home and had a fairly decent experience the first time around.
43241		There was this funky smell in it that he eliminated and the car looks better than it did when I got it.
43242		I asked to speak to a supervisor, never happened.
43243		She was such a smartass.
43244		I felt bad for her so didn't stop the massage and get up and leave like I so wanted to.
43245		It definitely gets filled up, so holding conversations do become a little difficult when it gets noisy.
43246		Then a group of people came and were immediately attended before me.
43247		I am waiting for an excuse to head back.
43248		Finally we got attention!
43249		He took it like a champ and just seemed to take it in stride.
43250		With my key in hand, I went upstairs to my room, only to discover someone else was living there.
43251		The too much metal flaked wheat is really solid IMO.
43252		I arrived early and while I waited and shopped around I was asked multiple times if I needed any help or wanted a soda or water.
43253		"Now today I stopped in because I wanted to ""kill two birds with one stone"" and get my nails done/ re-attempt to get my hair cut."
43254		I was on my 22nd floor and I could hear music alllll night from chayo at the linq.
43255		They have comfy seats for your wait, though.
43256		I'm pretty sure there's nothing else a person needs from a coffee shop.
43257		The only downside to Cantina Laredo is their dessert selection.
43258		I know that the woman who works the front counter there is great at interpreting what you want and helping you order, but I wasn't expecting such thorough service on the phone!
43259		I ordered delivery one Thursday night and waited an hour for delivery.
43260		At no point in time was I rude, so this isn't a spite induced attack at the store, the store manager even agreed with me.
43261		Well, he finally showed up.
43262		Thank goodness my husband and I ignored  the 2 star reviews.
43263		Take my advice and spring for the video package - you'll thank me later!
43264		Note that it can get a little cold in there during the fall and winter.
43265		We got there at around 7pm and their first available seating for 2 was at 9:30.
43266		I think they literally pulled them out of the refrigerator and microwave them and brought them to our table!
43267		One thing this place could do better though is to have a menu.
43268		For $5 we were not expecting a full salad bowl, but that is exactly what we got!
43269		2 things that really stood out on craptastic service!
43270		Be prepared to dig deep into your wallet though because this place is not inexpensive.
43271		My only concern (not even a complaint) was the portion of the dish.
43272		The decor is dated and the tables are sticky.
43273		There were people with the same size party and no reservation that got seated before us, so it wasn't off to a great start.
43274		However, staff on the phone were pleasant, pizza arrived when they said it would arrive, and delivery guy met me outside the Golden Nugget where I was staying.
43275		This place definitely met my exception.
43276		Rudest office and rules about going into an appointment I have ever seen in my life!
43277		We did go to Dickey's (7th street and Greenway) and had some decent bar-be-cue.
43278		Eat here if every other restaurant in area has already closed.
43279		We walked up and were pretty impressed.
43280		It seemed like they always had some kind of promotion going on.
43281		I had my kids with me and to me as a server I would get it quicker than that.
43282		The menu is a relic of 70s greeb fare that would even make a Wetherspoon's look gourmet.
43283		My only suggestion here is to make sure that you blend the meat in with the macaroni and cheese otherwise the flavours from the pork ribs are a little too much and the macaroni is simple bland/boring.
43284		If you don't have a groupon and are planning to eat at this place, you are out of your mind.
43285		Only complaint would be that the green sauce wasn't spicy enough just tasted plain.
43286		F-U-N!
43287		I went home and actually shave again because they did such an awesome job.
43288		But hey i still gave them the benefit of the doubt, well I was proven wrong.
43289		We usually go to the Swiss chalet in Oakville, where we have had no issues with the service of the waitstaff.
43290		The portions are big so we took lot to go.
43291		When I finally take time out for a mani/pedi, I expect to relax, not be tortured or made to feel like an obtrusion!
43292		Other guests who became too impatient to wait their turn actually went in that line (and the Mail Line) so they could be called ahead of the rest of us in the regular check in line.
43293		It's Yogi's, so the food is always good.
43294		However, presuming we paid $25 per person, I would say this was good quality.
43295		the feed backs that people left about fixing things and apartments are not move in ready are in fact true!
43296		My Italian grandmother lived to be 102 years old, and she taught me everything I know about cooking Italian food, so I am almost ALWAYS disappointed when I end up ordering from somebody's menu.
43297		Empty plates literally got cleared when the last piece of food was taken off it.
43298		Let me start with - i really enjoy Gallo Blanco.
43299		We traveled home and the pizza smelled delightful.
43300		"That should alarm you when ALL meat sold in the US is processed with chemicals for preservation, even the expensive ""local"" garbage."
43301		No added shrimp on one of our dishes.
43302		the dining at Giuseppe's is neither fine, expensive, or classy.
43303		Note it can be noisy.
43304		Cheap drinks.
43305		I would not recommend big groups to eat here cuz it was a little difficult to get a reservation considering the amount of people we had (8).
43306		Too bad it's not socially acceptable to lick your plates clean, otherwise I would've given back one spotless serving dish to the waitress.
43307		My initial beef was the cider options were limited to Strongbow.
43308		The size of the drinks here are a little different than a usual place so don't be surprised when you get your coffee from the bar and it's about the size of a little water cooler cup.
43309		I'd rather go to The Saloon where I can watch the Steelers/Pens in a festive, but not out of control atmosphere, and have a good time with my friends.
43310		The line is usually fast, the longest I had to wait was 15 minutes.
43311		They really try to go that extra mile at the Elara...
43312		if I could give them zeros stars I would.
43313		The prices are not as great as some are saying, especially for this quality.
43314		It is a small place so probably not a good place for large groups.
43315		The crew also never tried to 'upsell' procedures.
43316		This time I asked for the (UNAVAILABLE) Cod & ended up ordering Deep-fried Trout & Chips, a tasty fish that I grew up on:-) A couple of bites of fish & fries and I was FRUSTRATED AND DONE.
43317		Been here 100 times already, I think it's time for a review.
43318		They were great - on time (early even!
43319		No napkins or cutlery.
43320		Is it expensive, you bet your rear end it is.
43321		All though the Ford did work and had way more functioning bells and whistles then the Jag.
43322		But would stay open an EXTRA 10 minutes because we care so much about our customers.
43323		She also sold him fries without asking me.
43324		For a positive, they use Heinz ketchup.
43325		There was a party of about 20 so that probably caused a little delay.
43326		We spoke to the owner about our service before we left explaining we have no problem paying the bill but were very unsatisfied hoping she would compensate us somehow.
43327		And taste very blend.
43328		Wife and I decided to splurge on our Anniversary dinner and went with the most expensive Prix Fixe option.
43329		The service  was great though.
43330		But if you do, please try the steak I mentioned it was really good.
43331		I'll clean my table just make food better.
43332		I would recommend using Priceline when booking your hotel.
43333		"It's the one more expensive place in Madison that I've consistently thought ""this would survive in a bigger city."""
43334		"The Decor was fine (pretty usual ""Big-fat-greek-wedding"" style of decor), there were cloth tablecloths and napkins, and the karioke music was cheerful overhead."
43335		When the gentleman came back from the repair bay, I was expecting a medium sized bill to repair my tire... but he told me it would be $9 or so.
43336		Beans are so easy even Taco Bell manages to not ruin them... Just saying!
43337		I honestly have had some pretty bad ones, and this is true to form.
43338		I will make sure to let people know how they are but good thing found a dentist down the street from them.
43339		You read me back my order and it sounded right.
43340		Showed up to the hotel and they are fully booked.
43341		And my view is the outside duct work and heating and cooling unit.
43342		This means that 3 staff members get to walk through my apartment, while I'm packing, and evaluate the condition, even though that will happen again after I move out.
43343		I also had the Pork Soup Dumpling which was decent.
43344		They other guy want to prorate the tire and still charge you money.
43345		Good luck everyone.
43346		She doesn't give you numbers that you have to meet or tell you how you've messed up.
43347		Previously, I'd had folks tell me I needed a whole new muffler system, and I'm not rich, so the 1200 to 1500 they were quoting me was just too much.
43348		The price is responsible.
43349		Everyone knows what the DMV stands for and that fact makes them attract a certain type of staff, especially when it comes to management.
43350		The menu was nice and I loved the options that were offered.
43351		Great place for people watching.
43352		Instead, the guy gave me a free frozen margarita mix that includes tequila.
43353		You'll love it even more if you prefer the beans in your chili to have a crunch to them.
43354		Always in line FOREVER.
43355		Full off of half the serving of 4 bucks of heaven in your mouth.
43356		Other reviews mention that the service is bad or rude.
43357		The people all said everything my friends and I wanted to hear to just get us to keep traveling with them and shut us up!
43358		I had been to one of these in Virginia a few years ago and was not impressed.
43359		The seating is crowded.
43360		Parking can be a little tough too during busy hours as well.
43361		I got the chicken and cheese quesadillas which were practically cold but I ate them because I was famished.
43362		I'm in a food coma now and still have leftovers in the fridge.
43363		We were helped by a woman who clearly didn't know what was going on in her own store.
43364		I've been to several stores before and only received below average service and had issues to deal with after.
43365		"Thanks Bread Company *brofist*

Do I remember much about the food?...No."
43366		We have been coming here for years but our last 2 car washes have been terrible.
43367		As a new patient anywhere it can be tedious filling out paperwork, getting the insurance straightened out and such.
43368		They are more costly than store bought brands.
43369		Did I say this is noon on a Sunday w/plenty of open seating?
43370		Bigger bowls please.
43371		I was enfuriarted by the way they treated me.
43372		That was riDICulous!
43373		The hotel experience started out great.
43374		The proteins (chicken, beef, pork) are slow cooked in their chile sauces--oh muh goodness, People...  First-timers: I recommend the 5 Street Tacos, this way you can sample most of their proteins & chile flavors (5 small tacos = really filling).
43375		...I said yes I told you that twice , and it's been ready, and after this we were finally seated.
43376		impossible to spend time on patio in the afternoon do to the intense sun.
43377		and gave me attitude!!!
43378		"For me, it basically came down to my 5 year old who said ""this car is cool...because I say it's cool""

That being said, if you are in the market for an AUDI, give these guys at Audi Chandler a shot."
43379		I took two bites and fed the rest to my dog.
43380		Their voices were raised and customers were all staring at me.
43381		We did walk up 2 minutes late but come on...
43382		Granted if you're a Shang Hai place and you can't do this right you might as well shut down or get yourself franchised like Asian Legend.
43383		It's hard to screw up a fried egg, but they did.
43384		Just plan your trip as its not the easiest to access and the parking spaces are limited.
43385		Unfortunately, my favorite aesthetician, Caroline, left to move on to bigger and better things.
43386		While a good portion of this can be blamed on the crappy sound system in the theater, the actors certainly played their part in it as well.
43387		It's simple really, put someone in charge, wait should never be more than 5 minutes, check your inventory and make sure you have SPOONS :)
43388		Had my packages delivered today to another house!!!!!!!!!
43389		Patio on fleek!
43390		I began to feel better.
43391		Let first state that I am a fan of Whataburger, This location is 24 hours and relatively close to my home, so this is my favorite to go spot to eat at for those late night munchies or a long night out.
43392		The croissant was light and flaky.
43393		I love Pho alot.
43394		Too many places will take advantage of those who don't know much about cars, this in definitely NOT one of those places.
43395		Order two coffees at the drive thru, drive away and the coffee is COLD!
43396		One positive note is that the actual therapist did seem very sweet, smiled a lot/offered water.
43397		Heaven in a box is what they should have called it.
43398		To put it in perspective, the best thing our neighbors have done is drunkenly throw up Taco Bell on our shared entry steps twice in the last two months.
43399		We told the waitress and spoke to the manager, and instead of taking that dish off the bill entirely, they discounted our bill by $6.
43400		She took it way better than I would have.
43401		For lack of a better way to put it, SOOOOOOO GOOOOD!
43402		Baby back ribs were not cooked enough and had funny taste.
43403		Parking can be tough.
43404		He is in and out in 2 minutes and cares not for your questions or concerns.
43405		She did not do any homework and finding a house with her was like taking a tour of the whole neighborhood.
43406		I think they thought we were doing family style which we were not.
43407		"Chanda lives on site so she is always around causing a stir, being hands on with your position is great in most cases however in this case Chanda is just ""M""essy!"
43408		while dining in u have unlimited refills and condiments...yippy!
43409		Fries are prepared and blanched everyday.
43410		"We called HSA and one of the supervisors got us an appointment for Monday ""morning."""
43411		It is so cheap.
43412		With this dish, my dad believed that he has had better fried rice.
43413		If you need to go to AA  here's the place to go.
43414		I HIGHLY recommend asking for both and paying extra!
43415		The initial arrival was good, got in and out in 1 hour.
43416		I received a 15% discount on a future meal.
43417		It states it not good for kids, I disagree we took our youth soccer club here (8/9 year olds) and they loved it.
43418		As for the store itself I have only found the employees helpful and knowledgeable.
43419		Since I was so used to how slow the pharmcist service was at Walgreen (specifically the one located at Alma school & Germann), I didn't even bother pulling up the drive way expecting my meds to be ready.
43420		I had this company clean my house a year ago and they did a great job.
43421		I'm tired of going into places like Not Just Coffee or Hex and not being able to order a small.
43422		I've shopped here for many years, and not had bad experiences.
43423		If you want quality pizza, go to Nello's.
43424		In the end, I got her a half order of steak and fries with ketchup which she enjoyed.
43425		When I used him in the past his attitude was very nonchalant but I thought who couldn't service a unit right?
43426		Owner is CRAZY!
43427		They had no problems charging my credit card immediately, but they cancelled my appointment ten hours ahead (they e-mailed me past midnight.
43428		I know they have polite employees as I experienced with the first gentleman.
43429		As with other trades, the guys that did come out and do the work were not quite as nice, etc.
43430		It's like going to eat at Disneyland and surprised everything is so damn expensive.
43431		Its disappointing finding out she's transferring to a Laseraway in NYC!!!!!!!!!!
43432		Although, the beef sandwich was pretty good.
43433		Of course, the item we picked was out of stock yet they had one on the floor.
43434		Unfortunately, last year my insurance was changed and I had to see a different group of doctors.
43435		Thanks, US Postal Service!
43436		Of course I wasn't weak minded as his Jedi Mind Trick failed.
43437		We did some shopping on the strip and we we passed again at 10 there was a huge line waiting to get in.
43438		We were uncomfortably close to our stranger-neighbors.
43439		I was stuck.
43440		We were told that there will be renovations to upgrade this already fine place.
43441		Yes our complex has had break ins.
43442		But although my hair appeared to be bad, it was actually much, much worse.
43443		Takes your car for joy rides then says nothing is wrong!!
43444		The soup, French onion, was the best part of the meal.
43445		Luckily a tall skinny male server came an took it and brought our card.
43446		Just take note that it seems that the menu on their site is outdated.
43447		Thank you flamingo for helping me when the cosmopolitan racially profiled me.
43448		Unfortunately for me it was a bad alternator.
43449		I liked how it wasn't as noisy and busy since they didn't have a casino.
43450		Parking is sometimes hard to find.
43451		The only bummer is that the audience wasn't into it at the show we went to which sucked some of the life out of the place.
43452		But Amazon wouldn't partner with anyone that couldn't fulfill my delivery efficiently and competently, right ??
43453		But still thanks to Rachel for helping me with great patience!
43454		They don't stuff the sushi rolls with tons of rice.
43455		I will say that our driver was very kind and friendly.
43456		Like we were supposed to know.
43457		The wheels weren't even wiped down.
43458		This place kills it.
43459		Regarding Dosas, the less said the better.
43460		The fries were sweet and salty, with what seems to be house made ketchup.
43461		It was the best part of the meal.
43462		While the service was impeccable I am more interested in how good the food is.
43463		So cool.
43464		When I finally did, I was like a kid in a candy store.
43465		They need to trim the meat better.
43466		I come here once in a while to discuss business or study, and it's generally pleasant.
43467		So I would literally stay anywhere else in las Vegas but here.
43468		Very small inside though.
43469		My son had short ribs and that was the best out of all the meals.
43470		Good luck to you and yours with The Bakery Phx.
43471		The beef was on the tougher side.
43472		I would add a photo but I ate everything too quickly.
43473		Based on my recent experience...  GO ELSEWHERE!!!
43474		The exterior design who the hell sees water fountain in front of McD.
43475		I think part of your job should be to know at least a few of those shooters and beers to recommend to customers.
43476		TALK ABOUT GERNEROUSITY AND HOSPITALITY.
43477		Introduce yourself to your guests -- hell there are only about 2 of them, so it shouldn't tax you too much.
43478		I hear the pizzas are good.
43479		Again, the location can not be beat if you want to be in the heart of Old Town.
43480		Only downside to the gift shop is they didn't have a shirt in the size I wanted.
43481		It left no possibility for a futile attempt to make what was damaged look undamaged.
43482		This shop WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU of they know they can get away with it.
43483		We must have just waited 5 minutes when our order arrived.
43484		Great location with parking.
43485		The bar was only about 60% full so I felt lucky to have beat the dinner rush.
43486		When I said thank you but we will go somewhere else she HUNG UP on me.
43487		The amazing mechanic at the other shop tightened the bolt for FREE!!!
43488		I have told the people at the drive thru window many times but they always make it before the burger so it just sits on the counter and melts.
43489		Let me start by saying the food is good.
43490		Now, I could be wrong, but isn't it the insurance agents job to make you feel like you are being taken care of?
43491		The other flavoured bagels are not as good as they sit in the bin and does not move as quickly.
43492		I tried my very best to keep my hand as still as possible but I was a little confused why she couldn't wait till I was at least done with the massage part of the pedi.
43493		Thought it would be good.
43494		The service was fantastic.
43495		Plus I prefer good quality, durable, and elegant furniture, so IKEA is not the place for me.
43496		So stop wasting your time and get to Malee's NOW.
43497		Tonight I placed an order through the Order Up app from R&B's pizza.
43498		Instead of barely meeting expectations, gene woods blew them out if the water!
43499		"Jack English and his staff specifically Jan and Randal are the epitome of the commercial ""Like a Good Neighbor State Farm Is There""."
43500		Usually there's an attendant on duty wiping and sweeping.
43501		With all the powder sugar it can get pretty messy.
43502		I've never left a restaurant more hungry than when I arrived before now.
43503		If you want a true honest boat mechanic I strongly suggest coming to Gerry's Marine...
43504		The staff here are definitely not afraid of arguing/lashing out at customers.
43505		No harassment and I continue to service my vehicle there.
43506		It's really lovely and in a great location.
43507		Good management skills, asshat!!
43508		We had to take our pup to the vet, and on our return when we were pulling into our driveway, we noticed he was done and our neighbor had grabbed our washer to wash her front patio!
43509		You have to try if you're a big fan of sour soup and coconut milk!
43510		She was kind and very personable, albeit , highly overwhelmed.
43511		ESPECIALLY for a joint that has such awesome location, building and name.
43512		My kids thought it would be fun to order their own and hopefully take some home, but one ordered a chocolate chip pancake and another ordered a waffle.
43513		I personally wouldn't order the drinks again if I were back.
43514		I did have to park in the back of the parking lot as there weren't any spaces left.
43515		Fortunately I have the reflexes of a cat and smashed it with one of Blue Martinis excellently durable menus.
43516		This is a small enterprise and does not have an office staff, so they may be slow responding to emails.
43517		The idea is that you can reserve a seat in advance and know where you will sit.
43518		Fair deal!
43519		If I wasn't worried about my waistline I'd go there a lot more often.
43520		The good fire not the spicy fire.
43521		I had raved about this place and posted it on two different local FB pages saying how great it was.
43522		We wouldn't have left as 'quick' as we did if not for a small family of 3 across the way receiving their food, having finished their order and receiving their second order while we remained at our booth sipping on our waters having gone through our reading material twice already.
43523		When that time came she never returned my call but was very happy to sell me things such as grown crystals from her website.
43524		The cheese was good.
43525		Faked me out again.
43526		Son lost the only key fob to his truck.
43527		Inside floors still had stuff on them, looked like they did a quick job.
43528		The gentleman staffing the bar seemed a bit gruff, but a good caffeine fix will help me forgive even the orneriest grump.
43529		It was nice to have a restaurant that didn't serve pizza in the top five.
43530		As soon as we sat down the waitress brought their drinks, which they had ordered 15 minutes prior, and said she would be right back.
43531		I have had a lot of trouble with accountants in the past not performing and making very expensive mistakes on my returns.
43532		Its busy and maybe they need more training).
43533		The only downfall is on my end that I don't have more friends who like sushi as much as I do.
43534		The first rolls were great and we love sushi so we kinda know what we like...
43535		My hope is in writing this review other see it, and do t get scared or bullied into treatments they don't need!
43536		But I keep coming back because of the food...
43537		Reasonably priced with student discounts, it takes a few hours to go through all the rooms.
43538		I answered that it was okay thank you.
43539		EAT AT YOUR OWN RISK
43540		They could retire on their Greek Salad Dressing trade secrets.
43541		Impeccable !!!!!!!
43542		What's more, if you run out of a side dish, you can ask for more - same goes for rice and it's at no extra charge.
43543		As if the beef was cut from the holiest cows if the land!
43544		I was very full at the end of the meal.
43545		Not horrible, just awkward!
43546		I booked the appointment for 12 sharp and she arrived at 1:15.
43547		We were shocked.
43548		I know the strip can be pricey but come on!
43549		My favorite place for a good dump.
43550		You're fooling yourself if you think you know of some where better.
43551		"I decided to go use the washroom and I came across a sign saying ""how to flush the toilet""... Little things like this, should be fixed.."
43552		Too die for.
43553		Make sure the floor isn't slippery etc...
43554		My one complaint is how small that crazy parking lot is, super scary!
43555		-The room is very nice.
43556		Called warranty company Old Republic and they sent AM/PM PLUMBING and got the run around for 2 days.
43557		Thought it would be nice to take my husband to dinner.
43558		Line is always busy.
43559		When I'm on this block again, I know I should try one of the other stalls but damn, it'll be hard not to just return to T&T for the exact same order.
43560		Drawn in by the vibe, we were not planning on falling in love.
43561		Charged for the rice you skipped over on.
43562		He should be retrained on his customer  service attitude.
43563		I will definitely be a return customer for any services I need in the future.
43564		Ever since I came back from Ireland I've been looking for a place that comes close to traditional Irish food only to be disappointed.
43565		We've had 2 dental experiences at other businesses in Las Vegas where we felt scammed, both times after our first TLC experience.
43566		Finally  20!minuets later seated!
43567		I had called in advance to see if they offered non-dairy milk and was told they had soy and almond...Yasss!
43568		I mentioned that we were celebrating a double birthday and the employee said she would notate our account so there would be a surprise for them in one of the rooms.
43569		Parking is very limited in back so you may have to get creative with where you park.
43570		I was intimidated by this magnificent looking sandwich.
43571		Food is not just tossed on a plate.
43572		I used to go to this location of Global Pet because we had had such great experiences with the staff.
43573		"Without double checking or asking me to show her the wallet I was looking for, she immediately told me, ""No, we don't have that wallet here."
43574		Takes about 1-2 hours depending on your speed, ability.
43575		It's been over a month since getting my new home and I have yet to get keys to my mailbox for which they say takes 7-10 days.
43576		The location is tucked away inside of the Target shopping center, so it can be very easy to miss.
43577		I have boycotted the Bruegger's in Mkt Square for a few years now and haven't really been back to any other location.
43578		Some other 7-11's are really bad at that!
43579		Went back around, told that always rude guy what happened.
43580		If you want good pizza I would recommend Gianni's pizza in hopewell.
43581		They are very pushy, much more than other companies.
43582		We checked in around 12:30pm and had some friends over.
43583		However they stayed all day until the job was done and done right.
43584		I stay in Vegas just about every other month and I've never had a worse customer experience and on my birthday weekend!
43585		I was struck by a trucks mirror while helping a stranded motorists.
43586		"Her response was, ""What Do You Want Me To Do"" in a very brash tone."
43587		2 people could not finish all that food.
43588		Fortunately, when we got home and gave the three-fourths of it that we had left over to the dogs, they were ok with it.
43589		We made a reservation on Open Table ahead of time, but it wasn't too busy at 6 p.m. on a Sunday.
43590		Service was okay, and the food was good.
43591		I don't think we paid more than 30 for Uber there from the airport.
43592		It was in fact to sweet for me.
43593		(Eventually a delicious red sangria was selected, which went down entirely too fast.)
43594		If u are a smoker this is paradise for u.
43595		When I first started coming here, I was actually surprised how nice and helpful the staff were.
43596		At other places they can be too large, and not too big on taste, and quality.
43597		On a bright note, the Mac and cheese was incredible.
43598		These kids don't deserve your condescending, holier than thou, attention starved bad attitudes.
43599		It was rock hard.
43600		Being in the liquor industry you come across a lot of places that have sub -par service  and/or outrageous prices.
43601		Our server had our grill switched out about 3x just to keep our food from burning from each different flavor of sauce, they were definitely on top of that.
43602		I was shocked when he offered to order me a brand new spa with the missing jet and agreed to pay for the crane, installation, setup and everything.
43603		I must say that the staff was very friendly tho.
43604		If you're looking for fine dining, this isn't your place.
43605		I was so looking forward to this great opportunity and at such an elegant chapel since I was recently engages and eager to get married.
43606		My friend and I came to Cibo on a Friday night and we decided to sit out on the patio so we could enjoy the nice evening weather.
43607		Cold food and they combined two separate orders in one large container and acted like they did me a favor.
43608		The driver seemed nice enough interacting with us and joking around.
43609		We had put the do not disturb light on our room, but at around 1pm, they had called to see if we needed anything : bottled water, extra towels?
43610		I have to say that I have been back twice in the last month since my last visit which was in the summer and was not incorrect in my suspicions that the new parking and street through the center would ruin the atmosphere.
43611		But HAPPY DENTAL HAS RECEIVED PAYMENT FROM BOTH INSURANCE CARRIERS, so they don't care!
43612		She of course kept her attitude the whole time.
43613		But when all was said and done, our bill came to $35 and we got 5 drinks and the bean dip (with a double portion of chips), so I'd call that a deal!
43614		I know where I am making my next appointment!
43615		It had great reviews and I was also very excited to try the buttery buns Yelpers raved about.
43616		Halls are quiet.
43617		I know things go wrong, but this is crazy.
43618		Shitty!
43619		I did notice some table get serve better than other.
43620		The food is good, for fast food.
43621		Make a reservation this time and got our table without wait.
43622		We had a local independent Mercedes shop do a PPI a few months ago, and they came back with a laundry list of items that *needed* to be replaced (the sending units and fuel tank were Not on the list...), which was contradictory to the PPI done at the Mercedes repair shop and private dealership in Las Vegas where purchased.
43623		Best thing was the chicken tortilla soup.
43624		"All the recreation a dive bar should have and the ""scenery"" of the clientele wasn't bad either."
43625		Maybe he shouldn't have told me that there were other sightings, but he offered that info and it was disturbing that no action had already been taken.
43626		Too much sauce.
43627		"Too many so-called ""celebrity chefs"" think that since they graduated from some overseas cooking school, bought a couple of tattoos, and an attitude, their new cooking show will make them cooler than Miles Davis."
43628		The chickpea fries were a little mushy and kinda weird.
43629		Ordered five plates of meat (1lb each) & three sides & only payed $85!
43630		[we tipped very well that night] The guy making our food brought us our food and engaged us in a friendly chat for about 15 minutes [much needed to restore his nerves].
43631		To be fair, the food here is delicious and my husband and I used to go all the time.
43632		Our total was about $25 and the portions were filling.
43633		You will have a much better experience.
43634		Only complaints are the boneless wings are a bit small and if you call in your order you will be lucky if the answer the phone if it's not already busy, and don't let them put you on hold they will leave you there forever.
43635		I was in a hit and run around X-Mas, cops told me I could keep my car on the road til I got it to a repair shop, car was towed HOURS after my accident, I couldn't do much being on a bed recovering.
43636		Although restaurant inside is great my husband and I chose to eat outdoors to see the pedestrians and traffic.
43637		Your going to get some good service and that your going to eat some good food.. Its Vegas Right?
43638		Dessert was the tiramisu which we almost licked the cup.
43639		We called a different company before this and the quote was ridiculous.
43640		The restaurant was not apologetic at all .
43641		To each his or her own but the only negative thing i have to say about reggies is PUT SOME BLACKTOP DOWN ON YOUR PARKING LOT!!!!!
43642		came and profusely apologized and offered a delicious filet in exchange.
43643		Upside is the crust is tasty and cooked well.
43644		It can be crowded and a long wait for takeout, and table service is a bit haphazard during busy periods.
43645		If it's worth collecting there's a good chance they have it.
43646		Lots of businesses just wanting that quick buck and they're gone.
43647		While waiting for dessert to arrive, our server brought us the bill!
43648		Fortunately,  another shuttle company driver offered to give us a ride for free.
43649		But only one toilet, haha.
43650		It seems like they serve quiet a few selection of beers and foods:)  To my surprise and amazement, they had an alcohol beverage and keep in mind, this is a coffee shop.
43651		People were getting their orders before me.
43652		I had a mishap filling a small hand truck tire with air compressor and the tire exploded.
43653		You won't be disappointed.
43654		I like thick eyebrows that look like they belong together as a pair.
43655		Therefore, it's a convenient option for show-goers.
43656		I will be back because of her
43657		My favorite place to get an oil change.
43658		The health department needs to check this location out.
43659		I am a very understanding person and realize some times things aren't going to be perfect but when my kid is not treated right, that's when I cannot be quiet.
43660		It's my wedding, how can you make it up to me...YOU CANT!
43661		Make sure you get the cheese board!
43662		"I can't help u"" I was LIVID!"
43663		Immediately I wonder why this place isn't busy being in the heart of W25 during a weekday lunch hour?
43664		I am a rewards member at Michael's and I came across an item that would've totaled out as $50 and my rewards saved me and totaled out to $24 and I can honestly say that I am a forever returning customer.
43665		Several years ago when this place opened in Goodyear the food was served hot and was very tasty.
43666		You can definitely taste the tea in their milk tea.
43667		Disappointed they are not open Monday's...
43668		So, if you want to eat an awkward meal leaning over a coffee table, while sitting on the couch, this is the place.
43669		Wok grill was good and deserts had lots of variety.
43670		It was worth to wait a while to have my tattoo coloring appointment.
43671		I'm fat too.
43672		When we asked to hold the butter on the steak, the waiter mentioned there was dairy in the potato accompaniments and offered to substitute vegetables without us even asking.
43673		Furthermore, the staff there even knows how to treat ALL of their customers.
43674		These guys shower up an hour late o my party and showed up away after pick up time.
43675		I have tried so many of the online florists and been so disappointed.
43676		Save room for chocolate bread pudding and banana chocolate in phyllo.
43677		Tony, the salesman and partial owner, wasn't in our face, trying to push product on us.
43678		I know my insurance, I know it won't, but he would not let it go.
43679		Yesterdays nurse and doc were fast and friendly but did not waste our time.
43680		Sushi Rock is overpriced and their sushi is sub-par compared to this place.
43681		Yak!!!!!!!!!!!!
43682		Unfortunately it's ~1200 miles away from home!
43683		We simply want a unit that works!
43684		The only downside is that they don't have fountain sodas, so no refills... and hot tea is not free either.
43685		I was expecting to pay WAY more than that for that week.
43686		However, we did feel they were a bit pushy with purchasing their insurance plan, even though we already have our own.
43687		My biggest issues with my brows in the past is when I get them done I feel like no one has listened to me or looked at them before proceeding.
43688		Any business that is local and community based gets an immediate 1 star bonus.
43689		Let me start by saying I have frequent ed this restaurant many times and food is very good.
43690		A minor thing of note, decor was a cross between Starbucks and Target with lots of red and orange colors, not that it mattered but it looked a little strange.
43691		Cheap, strong drinks and hole in the wall.
43692		Food was fine ..
43693		I ended up going to the pro store at town square and the girl picked three great colors for me!
43694		Food was fine.
43695		If it forced to eat one type of food for the rest of my life, it would be pizza.
43696		Within a day we knew it had to be replaced, and a new unit might be 2 or more days out.
43697		At first glance, this restaurant seems destined for success: great location to take advantage of the resurgence of downtown Willoughby, complimentary valet parking, an alfresco approach to dining with outdoor tables and chairs flanking Erie Street, smells of freshly baked pizza permeating the air.
43698		The service isn't bad.
43699		Needless to say there was not a crumb left.
43700		The security guard, Matt came up and saw that I was just sitting there and these women were acting all crazy and yelling at me, yet Matt made me move.
43701		So I have gone here several times for drinks with friends and occasionally have ordered food that was pretty tasty.
43702		I wanna start off by saying I really liked this place and had high expectations for this place.
43703		The genius even went so far as to clean the entire laptop as it was dirty.
43704		The lady at the front said she would be able to do it so we didn't have to wait.
43705		I don't send food back to the kitchen, it frightens me.
43706		The first few times I dined at Destihl, I wasn't fond of it.
43707		Our server was friendly and animated, always with a smile on his face.
43708		I paid more for a suite at the CRUMMY Eastside Cannery than I would have paid for for a 5 star on the strip!
43709		The only down side was the waiter smelled a little musty.
43710		Never look here for help.
43711		But the older I get the less tolerant and grumpy I get haha, and I'm sorry but I didn't think I would have the patience to deal with the onslaught of ants coming that I KNEW we would battle all summer this year.
43712		I'm here to have fun not be on hold for over an hour.
43713		We have two dogs and joined the Banfield plan, with the full intention of getting fantastic service while saving money.
43714		Who doesn't have lemonade!?!
43715		Girl at the front counter was a smart ass.
43716		Perfectly battered.
43717		I've heard rumors that some plates can take several staff members meticulously working together for twenty minutes to plate and now that I have dined here, I can attest that rumor is most likely true!
43718		The orchestra was too quiet, so it did not drown out the sound of the ballerinas as their pointe shoes clomped on the floor.
43719		We hit the Rexdale and Martin Grove location after picking up our son Christmas Eve from Pearson and not much was open at all.
43720		NO shots inside the house.
43721		Looking for a flyer item,  they don't know where it is,  then don't know if it's in stock and woah!
43722		No long hrs in the waiting room.
43723		The only problem this caused was that we still needed room for dessert.
43724		Started getting sick and not feeling so well during the wait.
43725		The fish look like a deck of cards and taste like it too.
43726		I stayed at the Flamingo for the first and last time.
43727		I cleaned my plate, which is saying something as I never finish my food.
43728		I ordered the bowl with brown rice, black beans and steak.
43729		Had to send the broccoli back for a little extra steam.
43730		I get a call that my car DOES NOT need a motor.....GLORY!!
43731		After I placed my order in the drive thru, I drove up and my food bag was already out the window.
43732		Came by for a second opinion when AZ Major Appliance Repair accused us of abusing our microwave handle.
43733		Drove 40 miles from the west valley to check out this bakery and wow was I ever disappointed.
43734		This place is a little hidden and hard to find.
43735		"Even though the menu is translated into English, the names of dishes are not always very descriptive (""What's the difference between spicy chicken and chicken in hot sauce?"
43736		I had fun while in college, but not too much.
43737		Take the points and jump, just want a comfortable room without all the BS.
43738		She brought the breadsticks over to us late ...just lots of little things.
43739		I don't usually like eating burgers but this one wassss AMAZZZZZING AND JUICY JUICY JUICY.
43740		There's not that much traffic that would delay a delivery by 30 minutes.
43741		He also placed the bill after just 10 minutes of sitting down.
43742		First time here was 8/26/18, last time will be 8/26/18!
43743		If you are ordering this to be delivered to a work address or other institutional facility, never fear, the driver I had tonight called twice - once when leave the shop and one when he arrived here
43744		Hadn't been to Benihana's for years but had loved it when I was a kid.
43745		"They finally arrived at 4 pm
5) the movers were nice and gentle with our furnitures."
43746		Walked in to a very warm cluttered place on a hot Cleveland morning, no AC, no fans.
43747		Don't be fooled by the hole in the wall appearance.
43748		My insurance company handled this issue for me.
43749		Thanks for reading!
43750		We were significantly far off, but after going back and forth on numbers for about 20 minutes Blake indicated he could get me close to where I needed to be, but needed to pull my credit in order to do it.
43751		I was beyond livid.
43752		On a good note, they did not charge me for the meal.
43753		They were one of the few places downtown to be open late on a Monday (why do downtowns hate Mondays??
43754		I took my car to Rebel Automotive because of the high marks it received on Yelp (All of the mechanics that were recommended to me by friends were closed on Saturday).
43755		ahhh the hype.
43756		It isn't a huge patio area so I can see how it might be difficult to get a seat during dinner or perhaps lunch.
43757		The carrots could have been a bit more slender.
43758		However, my friends and I all agreed it balanced out when it was actually food + show combo.
43759		Not to mention it's dirt cheap.
43760		This one is right near my house and it got good reviews on here, so I decided to give them a try.
43761		I can't want to travel back to Toronto/Port Credit area!
43762		Manager agreed to comp the room for the night (at my request).
43763		The appetizers looked great but we never would have been able eat it all!
43764		I took a hand full of there cards and will tell everyone I know how great they are!!!
43765		My integrity was questioned more than once but had proof to uphold my word.
43766		It's less expensive and a better experience.
43767		I don't understand how this place isn't bangin' with a line out the door.
43768		The music was a touch on the loud side, so if you want to get some work done, I'd recommend bringing headphones.
43769		Mastros ruined steak for me, talk about melt in your mouth.
43770		However I went to Heggs auto group in Mesa and they completed my deal in 2 days with a affordable down payment and great interest rate.
43771		Clearly whoever made the reservation didn't know what they were doing.
43772		It had unbelievably low mileage and was in pristine condition.
43773		Music is not deafening.
43774		The first part of going down can be dangerous and it is easy to slip, so be careful!
43775		If you are looking for a date night where you just relax, I wouldn't necessarily say this is your place.
43776		Mmm, glands.
43777		No one ever makes you feel welcomed in a genuine type way.
43778		I expect to get ripped off in Vegas, but this place takes it to a whole new level.
43779		Vegas is one of those places that if you wanted to have a $5.99 Steak and Eggs Breakfast, you totally can do that.
43780		I went about two hours before closing and they only really had jerk and bbq chicken left (which btw, were pretty small pieces).
43781		People were getting their food who arrived after us.
43782		One positive thing was the vanilla milkshake...
43783		Back in the those days, the information in this book was pure gold.
43784		It will be the one and only time.
43785		I had oil splattered all over my car.
43786		The  previous handyman  who installed our new water heater did not attach the water softener properly.
43787		Coffee is VERY GOOD.
43788		This is the quickest I've ever had a pedicure done-a whopping 20 minutes!
43789		But when I got home they forgot my extra cane sauces.
43790		The chic there was very NOT helpful, had zero personality and said like two words to us.
43791		If our bill had been 30% higher I still would have considered it a bargain.
43792		I used to love this place, the food was great and the service was awesome.
43793		Laundry is so small and if more then a few people are in there, you cannot get around, so it is less hassle to go to a public laundry.
43794		I've been to this Resturant couple times and they did fair job.
43795		Disappointed by the lack of quality in restaurant purveyors' pasta offerings, Steve started to make his own pasta.
43796		While I wouldn't really call it Cuban, it was one mean sandwich.
43797		We saw the positive reviews on yelp and decided to go with Love and Care sitters.
43798		My favorite part of the complex was The Hostile Grape: a comfortable, stylish room with a very good selection of wines by the glass, including a Sine Qua Non that is almost NEVER available by the glass.
43799		"The ""sales"" person virtually disappears once you sign on."
43800		If I wasn't a pussy, I would have told them that they're selfish, yuppie fuckheads.
43801		They are super cheap!
43802		Customer service was over the top.
43803		Numerous times I caught them huddled in the truck talking, going through our boxes and even pulling out my guitar to play on it and breaking the guitar bag in the process.
43804		The miss at the counter broke down the menu for us because it was our first time.
43805		I've been to Sullivan's before but this will be my final visit.
43806		I will be returning for future purchase.
43807		No salted butter in the fridge case, i figured they were out, and asked if they had any.
43808		Rather than charging us for the full hour they bit into, we were only charged for the additional 15 minutes.
43809		The only gripe I have, is that there were jalapeños in the cheese sauce over the baked potato and it didn't say that on the menu.
43810		"You've got:

VARIETY."
43811		Banana cream pie was just there, not great.
43812		They have a large amount of rules.
43813		This soup comes with pigs blood and pigs feet which I'm not crazy about.
43814		"Desserts:

Brown butter carrot cake ($11) The cream cheese was so soft and it came with caramelized apples."
43815		The onion rings were the best part.
43816		The place is kinda neat looking - bunch of little goldfish, some of which swim upside down (for fun??)
43817		Heard about this place from a friend and thought it would be extremely expensive since we're talking about a restaurant owned by a world renowned chef (Bobby Flay) in Vegas.
43818		I am not crazy about the smoothies though.
43819		Ordered a steak medium rare, came to me well done.
43820		I WILL NEVER HAVE MY CAR WASHED OR DETAILED HERE AGAIN.
43821		I would go here all the time and ruin my waistline if only it were closer to me.
43822		I had to make the painful decision to put my very sick 16 year old, sweet cat down a few weeks ago.
43823		never asked if we wanted something else.
43824		I decided to come to this McDonald's location since it's on my way home.. so looking forward to a Big Mac and some nuggets.
43825		With as busy as this salon is, they could afford to give the service complimentary as opposed to losing a semi-regularly customer, family members (mother, sister, fiancé, mother in law, etc.
43826		I went with a friend and they ordered a veggie gyro with basmati rice.
43827		I got in on an intro price of $7 for 7 days!
43828		My friend ordered another, and that one was out too!
43829		Elephant bar is cool tho.
43830		The noodles were slippery and toothsome.
43831		C'mon MB!
43832		The serving staff & the hosts were beyond professional.
43833		For 1st timers this place can be hard to find as it is buried in an office center.
43834		This is called getto Vons for a reason.
43835		There are no signs that would lead a person to believe children are not welcome.
43836		Lot's of good brands and deals.
43837		The cashier had no problem with processing the return and asked if I wanted to exchange the items for anything else.
43838		Clearly, he was wrong for accusing me of sneaking in when there's evidence of my signing in.
43839		Got a yelp response within minutes.
43840		I dropped my car off at 2:30 pm for a routine oil change and tire rotation, picked it up a bit later and everything seemed to be alright.
43841		There were several seats available.
43842		You push the power button on the computer and NADA.
43843		As far as the resturant - I don't want to sound like my dad, but the live music was a little loud.
43844		THESE PEOPLE ARE CROOKS.
43845		Go to Frost at SanTan you can thank me later.
43846		Too much chocolate inside!
43847		Our drinks were always full and empty ones removed.
43848		The bun was good.
43849		I kinda lost my appetite.
43850		Call me crazy but I tried them again tonight hoping I could get a latte after work to enjoy my evening.
43851		The portions are big & the check is small.
43852		It's not like I wanted some fancy color that your 1000 shades could not satisfy.
43853		The way she talked to the staff was beyond mind blowing.
43854		I felt that was rude but kept quiet assuming she had a bad experience with someone.
43855		Kudos to the entire staff and management are due.
43856		A group of people came in after we ordered and got all of their specialty drinks looong before us.
43857		I was a little skeptical of Prime because I've been to the other restaurants on the Bellagio waters, and they were nothing to write home about.
43858		We didn't even get a picture of the rolls because we destroyed them in seconds!
43859		When a company has 4 stars and I can order delivery through Yelp, I don't hesitate.
43860		We tried this place soon after they opened, which was quite a while ago, and were not impressed.
43861		Alas our air conditioner did not work this year, and I had to get it repaired.
43862		Very professional and very CLEAN!!
43863		The parking lot gets pretty full and it's hard to drive through it, and it's close to uptown.
43864		My brother got a burger which he said was fine, it came with an egg on it and he found himself satisfied.
43865		Chubby guy with beard gave us a smile and looked  at our kids and changed his mind to not to take us.
43866		NICE CUSTOMER SERVICE.
43867		My husband raved about the crushed iced.
43868		There were 3 people at desks there who ALL IGNORED HER UNTIL SHE SPOKE UP!
43869		The design consultant was very nice, no doubt.
43870		My mom's grey roots completely vanish when we walk out of there.
43871		The SW Gas rep told us that the fix was easy.
43872		When my client contacted the home warranty company they told him to reach out to the a/c company who told him to reach out to the home warranty company.
43873		You get the payment out of the way getting what I feel is the most awkward step of a visit out of the way.
43874		Main dishes were good.
43875		If you want a delicious, fresh breakfast in Fountain Hills, our best recommendations are Sofrita on Avenue of the Fountains (great coffee, interesting fresh food, creative decor) or EuroPizza Cafe on Saguaro in Lakeside Plaza (good coffee, good fresh food, lovely view of the lake and fountain).
43876		"Step 7... All collectively agree that it's ""really hot in here"" and you'll ""just do one drink then head out""

Step 8..."
43877		the duck was cold and a bit too salty.
43878		don't get me started on the chips... (3 bowls).
43879		"ATTENTION YELPERS:
Do not yelp lower than 4 stars or the Sekong By Night Nazi will come and get you."
43880		If the other menu items are prepared with as much attention as the burgers, nothing will be disappointing.
43881		The barber chairs recline completely if you request a mustache or goatee trim and they swept numerous times while I was there.
43882		Add some taste to your food.
43883		If you are looking for a VW, give James a call.
43884		And the parking lot is huge.
43885		He also wanted to make sure I saw the work done before paying as he mentioned he can make any adjustments I would like.
43886		Just be sure to come in on an empty stomach.
43887		I called over a dozen auto repair shops, none of whom would take us in on such short notice with possible transmission issues.
43888		She made mine finally, at this point I had waited over 15 minutes.
43889		Did I mention how moist the chicken was?
43890		Wish they had some outside seating for this time of year.
43891		The cops were awesome and said they get called to Zipps (all locations) a lot over things like this.
43892		An upgrade should never look like a downgrade.
43893		By the way, all the other reviews seem to complain about a long wait.
43894		By the way, the guy that helped me the first time was still all into his iPad when I left.....
43895		My honey and I, in a moment of Mexican food desperation, stopped by Abuelo's because we've heard good things.
43896		Worth the extra few minutes drive to Royal Oak where LOTS of other food businesses are thriving.
43897		My friend enjoyed her lasagna which was drenched in extra sauce.
43898		SO GOOOD!!
43899		She laid into me!
43900		I thought I'd give it a try.
43901		Rushed us like crazy.
43902		i hate when people hold high expectations for ANYTHING.
43903		That is why i'm giving it a pity five - really this place is a 4 - more people need try the deliciousness!
43904		After a long night of extreme pain from what I think may have been passing a kidney stone with my head in the bowl, it may have also been a battle of food poisoning from their fine fish tacos.
43905		I understand that this is a popular place with law-enforcement.
43906		I sit down, to a different girl I think was named Jennifer who did a fantastic job might I add, So the woman who removes eyebrows, comes up to me and says hey honey, how you doing, its been awhile since we seen you.
43907		UPDATE: Went back yet again and somehow they made it better.
43908		The drinks server was a little slow and had to be asked for refills and extra items.
43909		2 of us went May 28 @ 9:35 pm at my suggestion as I'm a Mexican and Tex/Mex food aficionado and remembered having enjoyed the place a couple years ago.
43910		She got something completely different and an ass chewing.
43911		I had so much food that I took a lot of it home.
43912		Lmfao
43913		Bucket of beer deal was good to bring into the place.
43914		The only problem I have is that my dog figured out how to jump around the barrier gate that divides the lake/play space from the open area.
43915		"Well, here's how: 

For starters, when making a cheesesteak sandwich, call me crazy, but I like there to be cheese in it."
43916		They're very different and I feel besides the comparison of size, they really shouldn't be put into the same category, so let's not even go there.
43917		And in winter please turn the heat up a little, our food got cold much too quickly in the chilly air.
43918		Our busser was quite attentive--I'd definitely give him a star.
43919		The Chef's selection of deserts however was good.
43920		Some of their prices are ridiculously cheap.
43921		Once you place your order, food is out quick!
43922		Great coffee.
43923		(To it's credit, the meat was tender.)
43924		Good luck finding street parking at night.
43925		I found the cheese plate not very adventurous or interesting.
43926		The food was good and the prices were beyond fair.
43927		Went to it tonight with my family expecting something amazing from how much we heard about it, but oh we were up for a surprise.
43928		A restaurant should never be able turn the tide of happiness from positive to negative but they accomplished it.
43929		Parking might get tight.
43930		In the time we waited, the couple ahead of us sat, ordered, and ate.
43931		Well if you're looking for speedy service then this is the place for you!
43932		He didn't charge us a thing.
43933		We got the banana egg rolls for desert too and that was beyond what we expected.
43934		The seafood tower was more than enough food for two hungry romantics who had already overdosed on lobster, but we left nothing but a crab leg go to waste.
43935		My husbands food came 1 hour before mine.
43936		Basically, you're paying the same prices as Subway but getting a MUCH MUUUUUCH better gourmet legit sandwich.
43937		It was really nice how the server made that clear so when I got my usual bill and it was double I wouldn't be surprised.
43938		Shuttles run or if you prefer to drive its a straight shot to the main strip!
43939		I hope anyone who's not a diehard hop head doesn't think twice about a visit.
43940		How can a bakery not make a decent bitter tart!
43941		The fake wood floors is a nice touch if you are looking for cheap.
43942		The cornbread -we dubbed it the hockey puck.
43943		Ugh!!
43944		Eh, it's ok.
43945		It's very thin and cools very quickly.
43946		Too bad I can't give them a negative rating!!
43947		Now the look and ambiance was something out of a art show with several different art instillation throughout the building that the staff was more then willing to explain.
43948		No one there knows what they are doing.
43949		They told me that my struts were going to completely go out within the next hundred or so miles, which stressed me out because they quoted me $600 actually around what a typical shop charges however...a year or so later (20,000 miles) the struts held up just fine.
43950		I will come to Geo's Barbershop and only this shop.
43951		If you are interested in random acts of RUDENESS, this just may be the spot for you.
43952		So how's it all u can but u can't have more of what u want?!?!?
43953		Mastro's never fails to disappoint.
43954		We would always go to Goyemon when in Vegas but not anymore.
43955		I felt the need to provide the property with some good feedback since this place was given one star which is not true.
43956		It's a madhouse!
43957		Prices were ok the pictures online looks great so I booked.We arrived and were excited, the lobby was full of people and it look good.
43958		I stopped on my way home from work and got a 3 piece meal.
43959		The Pineville location has picked me up at this address without any issues in the past - I reserved a car, called them an hour or so before I wanted a pickup... clockwork.
43960		But is be lying if I said anything I tasted from Rocco's was excellent.
43961		It's hot as hell every time I go.
43962		It didn't need any modifications and it worked in seconds.
43963		You have to get THEIR attention when you go in to ask a question or even find someone to consign.
43964		Most techs just grind on leaving my nails sore.
43965		Flies everywhere inside.
43966		The ambiance in this place is a 5/5 to me This bar did not feel Vegas nor did it feel like Downtown Vegas.
43967		It's so dark, one can barely read the menu, much less notice that I have morphed into the Grimace after my second vodka tonic.
43968		A majority of milk tea places in Vegas make that mistake far too often -- by giving you a little bit a tea with a lot of milk and sugar.
43969		"Sometimes, when eating at higher-end establishments, the service is almost ""too servicing."""
43970		There was even a freakin' jacuzzi in the bathroom!
43971		Oh yea employees there park in the prime parking in front of the store.
43972		I didn't think they could be exceeded, but the food was a total oralgasm.
43973		Oh what I would give to give multiple NEGATIVE stars!
43974		Use to go to wing stop across the street but ATL all day now!
43975		Once we made it down we were quickly acknowledged and seated less than 10 our food was served.
43976		Love me some egg works.
43977		After our duplicitous Congress decided to longer support South Vietnam in 1975 (the South had held off the communists for three years after we left in 1972), the south fell, mostly because China and the USSR immediately doubled their support of the North.
43978		The drink was delicious.
43979		After puzzling through their menu of mouth-watering items (whole platter of burnt ends?
43980		A little salty due to the fries.
43981		I have been asked if I've been helped three times while waiting for my order.
43982		The inside of the hotel is boiling lava HOT during the warm seasons and a freakin maze to find where you are going.
43983		Diners can eat for free on their birthday, with proof of identity!
43984		GO TO SCADDABUSH.
43985		Needless to say the meat wasn't in the sandwich.
43986		We never got any missed calls nor responses to the e-mails we sent to him!
43987		Now THAT is an incredible restaurant.
43988		My Wife and I moved to Arizona due to my company sending me down here and we spent MONTHS looking at places online and everywhere looked kinda crappy so we were really worried.
43989		I had low expectations for dessert - it was a cornbread cake (weird!)
43990		For the price the portions are small.
43991		Mac and cheese the shining star of the meal.
43992		Previously the receptionist and groomers were pretty condescending about how I would request to have Jack cut (shaved) not your typical yorkie cut.
43993		WTHell Dude!!!
43994		I couldn't say enough nice things about it.
43995		As we were leaving she came outside with a card of a free coffee and still trying to give me.
43996		OooooRah to my fellow Marines that frequent this place.
43997		I hope he reads this and learns some manners.
43998		The spinach & cheese had too much cheese for my liking, which was my minor complaint.
43999		Had a bad experience at the BJ's Bar and came to Smashburger to finally eat.
44000		this is good mexican food on anabolic steroids.
44001		Injera is spongy in texture and the taste is reminiscent of sourdough, the wat dishes are essentially really thick stews that don't require a bowl.
44002		The humidity in winter in our house was so low that static electricity zapped us whenever touching anybody or metal objects in the house.
44003		Admittedly, the service was slow.
44004		I mean seriously, you can go to the Metro Health civic, get your prescriptions filled, and get your weekly groceries while waiting.
44005		It was fun.
44006		I had read in other reviews to park in an indoor garage, and to not leave valuable property in the car, and we are kicking ourselves for not heeding those warnings.
44007		This is an excellent place to go if you want to see how much stress you can put on your relationship.
44008		Then there was the rawhide, I mean, flank steak.
44009		Steaks melted in your mouth and I could almost cut it without a knife.
44010		It is on the expensive side and the clientele is generally high brow, pretentious types.
44011		To be totally fair, I should add that the people working this event in Scottsdale were beyond nice and pleasant.
44012		The one positive was that the chicken fried rice was delicious!
44013		Dr Germaine is a very very nasty man who acts like he is doing you a favor to allow you to be in his presence.
44014		With this great new staff, I have also had three instances where I have had missing items from my order.
44015		Treated me like a king when I looked like a bum cause I just got off of work.
44016		This Place Omgawd!
44017		Surprised this outfit hasn't been sued out of existence yet.
44018		Lastly, does the phenominal presentation of a dish make you sit and stare in appretiation, more afraid to eat it because of it's beauty?
44019		Never in the fact that so many women that came after me were dealt with immediately.
44020		We were afraid we wouldn't be allowed to really enjoy ourselves out there.
44021		The honey and orange zest NAIL it.
44022		Your 3 servicepeople are overwhelmed.
44023		Perfect hole in the wall!
44024		Try Jeans if you want great food !
44025		I was also having breathing difficulties.
44026		"I was very 
pleased with the treatment I received."
44027		Amazon gets it!
44028		I ordered sushi and a serve of Gyoza and they threw in a Miso soup!
44029		Definitely no complaints.
44030		Despite being the only customer that afternoon, she rushed through my cut.
44031		You have to pay cash and you will most likely not find street parking anywhere near there so look for a lot or try the streets around it.
44032		Still won't admit when they were wrong.
44033		My one complaint was that the air conditioning / heating was a little touchy and we kept having to adjust it.
44034		Employees standing around.
44035		They came with a decent maple sauce, but I didn't dip very many because they were honestly better on their own.
44036		The steak at Red Rock, I still can't forget how the beef melted in my mouth.
44037		The waiter was nice and recommended a Grouper with bearnaise sauce; sounded good right?
44038		I stopped eating pretzels for a while in nyc because they were bland to taste as I got older.
44039		It felt like we were being rushed out, but we still took our time.
44040		"The Good:
To my surprise though, decent food at very good prices (had the beef burrito w/cheese.. take out)."
44041		A smart company will use that opportunity to impress me NOT turn me away.
44042		I've been home all day WAITING for them.
44043		First course, slightly crispy duck skin (though not nearly crispy enough to my liking), with fine slices of duck meat, to be wrapped in rice paper.
44044		Unfortunately, on the same visit the order taker wasn't paying close attention to my order and so I got a latte that was wasaayyyy sweeter than I like.
44045		So close that we had to step back.
44046		The shop foreman rode with me to confirm that the alignment was satisfactory before I left.
44047		Target, the store, I like.
44048		The first couple of times weren't bad at all.
44049		I'm so used to the BS you get at a lot of hipster places that make you feel as if being there and dining there is kind of a burden to them...
44050		My only con is that the place is very small; 4-5 tables max... considering its always packed when I go...
44051		If your gonna build a stadium some where ... Make sure the area can take the influx of crowd and traffic .
44052		When I first moved to the complex about 4 years ago this was a great place to live.
44053		It's actually kind of scary.
44054		ARGH.
44055		They should have a buzzer or take down phone number to send a text.
44056		If the person helping me hadn't been a dude, I would've given him a big, slobbery kiss.
44057		The tables that crowd the tiny space make the environment seem too cramped, and an intimate night out might be shared with the couple at the table next to you.
44058		Staff reaction, polite frustration, security reaction - quick to judge and remove those that complain, management reaction - none.
44059		Beautiful grounds and scenery but I am rating just by the food, price, and atmosphere.
44060		I am big fan of Arabic food so I was thrilled when Paramount opened close to our house.
44061		Broke ass Mexican food at hipster prices.
44062		It's rare to find a restaurant that can perfectly poach your eggs - but alas look no further - the yolks popped upon puncture, whites fully cooked.
44063		A lot of complexes claim to be luxury living, but aren't.
44064		Fried calamari and roasted artichokes were good.
44065		Some guy gave me his two for one voucher so I was excited to eat at the buffet.
44066		They do have a great menu, and the food is good.
44067		Not so shortly thereafter, my friend had to STAND UP AGAIN AND ASK for the kalbi.
44068		You will laugh at yourself for coming all the way out here, as I did recently, and laugh at the furniture.
44069		Not a clue what the dressing was but it went well with the salad.
44070		Good luck getting that late of checkout for free at any other high-end Vegas hotel.
44071		He put it together without asking if it was together or separate.
44072		"Maybe I worked in the service industry too long but in my view you are supposed to say ""Hi!"
44073		Calamari was chewy.
44074		Sadly, the pumpkin pancakes are not available on the weekends.
44075		One of the things that made this class attractive to me is that I could meet this requirement within six weeks.
44076		That being said, if you're a restaurant and you're offering food to customers, it should be good, regardless.
44077		It was very quiet & foot soak/massage felt nice.
44078		I've walked out on five other deals throughout that period due to shady salesmen who must think that consumers cannot do research on cars nowadays.
44079		It's not the kind of coffee shop that I'd come to hunker down with my laptop at, take meetings or bring a date (almost.
44080		We've also rented from EZ from this facility and had a much better experience than Advantage.
44081		There were not very many free TV channels to choose from; basic, local news channels and whatever channel shows like 'Friends' reruns come on.
44082		I honestly could have eaten three or four of them in a row.
44083		Well, since my schedule's a little rock 'n' roll, I can't get over there (I will someday), so I had to try Coca Cafe's version, and I must say that it was a tempter if there ever was one.
44084		When the food came out my eyes got as big as my stomach felt empty.
44085		The staff was fairly friendly on the phone, pizza came in the delivery estimate time.
44086		in conclusion, i really need a new cup of tea and one more cupcake....... i'm thinking chocolate this time.
44087		Frustrating......
44088		We ate before the event because food was expensive of course.
44089		"Benefit from the coupon, that's when you add the stars like bacon, sauce, etc, etc 

ORDER WAS READY 20mins, also the restaurant calls to confirm your online order and calls again when your order is ready."
44090		"Apparently the monthly rental is not suspended during transportation because you are still ""storing your belongings."""
44091		We've had tap water everywhere else in Vegas and none of it tasted bad like that.
44092		If you are in your room when the pool is open, the music shakes your window and you can hear it clearly.
44093		It is really a tight-squeeze to get through the aisles and the customer traffic.
44094		The cons.........CASH ONLY.
44095		There was plenty of open tables
44096		I've cancelled appointments on them, last minute, and they always just reschedule.
44097		The theater is small so you get to see all the tricks up close and yet we cannot work out how he did any of these - especially the gold fish trick!
44098		I run a QSR concept, just a little advice...Customer Service is paramount in this day and time, again when someone chooses to eat with you, IT's A PRIVILEGE and you probably should not take it for granted.
44099		The only thing I remember was feeling underwhelmed by the bread.
44100		The only downfall as mentioned by the other reviews is the design and lack of spaces of the parking lot.
44101		The police weren't called which seemed to indicate that the surrounding neighborhood had gotten use to having such an unusual place near them.
44102		Ordered spring vegetable rolls as an appetizer and it was out pretty quickly.
44103		At least they know how to handle seafood 10x better than SQ and theyre also a food court sushi business.
44104		Since then I have tired of paying the old salon $30 to do it wrong 95% of the time.
44105		He had called a couple of other places to ask about prices and people only seemed annoyed by his call.
44106		It was pretty busy but there was 2 mistakes on my order.
44107		I chose Destihl because it is one of the few restaurants in Champaign that can accommodate a large party, especially on a Friday night.
44108		Unfortunately, it was raining and we couldn't sit on the patio.
44109		Only she didn't bother to pick it up when she said she would... leaving him struggling to find a safe place for it over the weekend.
44110		I got a better printer and I was willing to pay a bit more, I think I ended up with the better deal.
44111		We went for Crab leg / Oysters Sun.
44112		Not even a spec of dust could I detect.
44113		Was givne a table about 3 minutes later...
44114		I almost wish I had ordered that instead of my fish except my fish had the BEST SAUCE IN THE UNIVERSE!
44115		We waited about 3 minutes when one of the guys comes out and literally FLOURISHES our 3 bags of food at us.
44116		Only negative and it's not really that serious is the Cole slaw which is just OK to me and not as good as the other items.
44117		The hostess at the front walked us through, gave a great explanation of how things worked, escorted us to our table, gave us a menu, and we were on our way.
44118		The decor has been updated in the last few years I would assume.
44119		They ask you how you want it cooked, but no matter what I have said, it comes out well done and clearly microwaved.
44120		The first time I went here they did a nice job.
44121		They will strive to correct your order should it fail to meet your standards and expectations.
44122		Stay at the Hard Rock it is so affordable and clean!
44123		Is it because we're in Aura's dead/dying mall?
44124		We are sweating!
44125		Cause if you miss one piece of paperwork you gotta go back!
44126		I knew then why people pay such a top dollar to go this place when I ate the first thing they served, Le Caviar (Caviar on a fennel cream).
44127		These two were the most unhospitable people I have ever met in my years of business travel.
44128		Four days ago I had the pleasure of dealing with Mel and got into a 2017 Ford Fusion.
44129		The only thing I regret the most is not having the money to tip her $5000 because I would do it in an instant!!!
44130		On top of that, they charged me an absurdly low price.
44131		Got there to pick up, said my name, and POOF the bundtinis were ready and boxes up.
44132		PS: Drinks aren't included in the ayce price anymore.
44133		I've never had a stylist take so much time and consideration.
44134		If you're really going to be a cry baby about popcorn prices and how the place is not immaculate, you need to grow up and shut up.
44135		Be warned not to forget anything.
44136		Please work on your ganache or filling and please make sure there is available flavors, especially on a 3 day (MLK) weekend!
44137		Vast assortment of hardware.
44138		A memorable night...miserably so.
44139		Want an amazing foot massage???!!!!
44140		Not been treated as poorly in ANY OTHER restauants in the Valley.
44141		The insurance company I was dealing with was difficult.
44142		There was no funny business done at this dealership whatsoever.
44143		any place that is going to use Tito's in their sweet tea is very okay in my books.
44144		The best thing about Cowtastic was the variety of toppings they offered for their frozen yogurt sundaes.
44145		THANK GOD FOR NEVADA POWER AND MY SPACE HEATER
44146		We saw him once and later at another business he came up to us and said hi and remembered us which really impressed us.
44147		I take the paper work to my doctor's office and luckily the doctor completed the form right away.
44148		I feel there is genuine attempt by Management to offer good service.
44149		But I did once schedule a massage and would not do so again.
44150		On a positive note the room that I ended up in was very roomy, great view, washer and dryer, two bathrooms, a awesome walk in shower with 3 shower heads, a kitchen, a sofa and couch, and a number of chairs, When I checked out the food court there were a number of good choices for a quick bite to eat.
44151		We were excited to eat here because of the name.
44152		*Now I remember why I have used Discount Tire for years...they know how to take care of their customers.
44153		One night I came in and this huge family cut in front of me.
44154		Next time, I would rather start 6 am to enjoy more of it.
44155		The 10 year warranty on this finish was also a plus.
44156		Don't hesitate to call this Company.
44157		Superior places for breakfast within walking distance of this place.
44158		Probably fun place to watch a game and hang with some drinks.
44159		Lets start with this: I am addicted to sea food... and I mean - I eat it at least few times a week.
44160		The only silly negative I can think of is that they had the tv show Doctors on in the waiting room and that show blows.
44161		Actually did not taste like it was unsweetened but oh well.
44162		"Finally, after over 30 days of constant calling, my car was ""fixed""."
44163		Nice stop when on the North Shore!
44164		A dirty fork, dish or glass never sat on the table long.
44165		I watched the tech do a pedi, drain the water,  and refill it for the next customer without sanitizing.
44166		You can't even tell you're eating tofu!
44167		The first thing is they should take the word Lebanese off the window that's what drew me in.
44168		The parking garage was conveniently full.
44169		Never had these problems with multiple on-line firearm transactions with Impact Guns or Sportsman's Outdoor Superstores.
44170		If you have never had steak and shake, you are not missing out on ANYTHING!!
44171		Not a good place to watch a game outside - most of the TVs are inside.
44172		Jeez...all of this work on my car for only $16??
44173		Downside is it can be pricey if this is a daily thing.
44174		It looked like a good place for lunch, pretty quiet for dinner.
44175		My boyfriend and I took the survey after a visit and were dissatisfied.
44176		The wings are delicious as usual as well as the potato skins.
44177		The bed was big and comfy the view of the golf course was lovely though they neglected to clean the ash tray on the patio.
44178		All that for $30 - I slid them a $50 and I hope they grabbed a case of beer for their weekend.
44179		Prices can be a little high if you don't get something on sale, but I think that's just all grocery stores anymore.
44180		I had picked out a dress out of the 5 options they gave me.
44181		Tough to figure out the parking there though so be prepared to drive around a bit or get lost coming and going from the underground lots.
44182		I always have trouble chosing just one thing on the menu.
44183		With him my pool knowledge would be zero.
44184		Having a family this was certainly a stressful time for us.
44185		So if it rains your out of luck.
44186		The techno music put me on edge lol.
44187		I do not trust anyone but these girls!
44188		They take nickel and diming to a new level.
44189		Getting married in Ohio, while we live in New York City made wedding planning difficult.
44190		Be prepared to come early on the weekend if you don't want to wait in line.
44191		The only issue I had was they were out of wheat bread.
44192		The other location told me they didn't have them on file.
44193		Agent was friendly enough, told me to get something to eat at the airport she would call when one came in.
44194		I was actually charged less than what was quoted.
44195		I declined their services and took the package to The UPS Store on Ann Road.
44196		I hate uni(sea urchin)...have had it in Japan, Italy and now in Las Vegas.....it is just one of those things...I keep trying to like it and keep gagging as it goes down.
44197		I am actually horrified this place is still in business.
44198		A 2-3 day job turned into 1-1/2 weeks.
44199		I was in a jam and on panic mode after my Expedition failed a smog test due to check engine light being on.
44200		I went to some random spot and they messed up my hair.
44201		I had no idea why we weren't given movie passes to see the movie at a later date, this time without the technical problems.
44202		One employee was laughing so hard (at a customers expense) that she couldn't wait on anyone because she was buckled over from laughter.
44203		Dr maxwell isn't like most doctors he has books smarts and common sense.
44204		Even tho I am standing right there, she just looks at me and nods yes instead of asking me.
44205		I hired an AZ moving company, but they left so much behind, I had to rent a 16' truck to move the rest of our belongings (these movers will not get a nice review from me)!
44206		However, she was nice enough to see if the cook was able to make it anyway.
44207		It was not crunchy and too soft for my liking.
44208		You walk into their retail room and hopefully someone will ask you if you want to see what you can get!
44209		I also requested a late check out and was given one extra hour.
44210		Beautiful hole.
44211		I checked out around 5 other vintage shops in Cleveland on the same day and Flower Child kicked all the others in the rear.
44212		They have better service, staff, and they've never made mistakes when serving meals--even when they're overwhelmed and packed with customers!
44213		If there were 10 stars, ShinBay would get them all.
44214		"I did not like it
-Loco moco  not my favorite either, nothing too special...
-Yamaimo Cake  not sweet!"
44215		I understand that they might have been slow because they were waiting on an ingredient, but neither of the two ever said that.
44216		I would HIGHLY recommend smaller events or even just a night out!
44217		We have been looking for a Lexus GS300 for a couple of weeks on Craigslist but ran into shady people selling cars.
44218		When we turned to leave a table magically opened up.
44219		This place is a little far for me to come.
44220		This guy Tyler is  HOT MESS.
44221		She illustrated professionalism and customer service.
44222		The physical space is quite small.
44223		Thanks a lot for a great 2 hour wait with only a fucking drinking fountain.
44224		The one gripe I have about the pizza is that the crust needs a bit more of a chewiness as I found it to be slightly dense.
44225		This place scared the living daylights out of me.
44226		Or anything else but this.
44227		The spring roll was good and the peanut dipping sauce was great.
44228		Busy, but no wait.
44229		I went to this place last Saturday after reading all the great reviews.
44230		Looking at the general admission lines, that wait was nothing.
44231		My friend was given a little attitude when she asked if she could sit next to me- whatever, chalked up to a miscommunication.
44232		The rooms smell lovely.
44233		First I'll say the service was great, the people that work there are really nice.
44234		While seated, our server brought us little snacks.
44235		I do love the home decor HL has to offer and have many things decorated in my home from HL however I ordered all of that online from their website.
44236		This place makes Bennigans look authentic.
44237		The best part of this show was laughing with my SO about what we just saw.
44238		Torture.
44239		The room transitions were poorly managed, with a bored looking person in a SHIELD t-shirt letting the music play a few loops before pressing the button to open the doors, making for a really engaging and immersive time, imagining you're in training for an actual government contract job, waiting for the instructor who is running behind due to a pile of paperwork and red tape.
44240		It gets very crowded.
44241		For the starter, get the House Fritas.
44242		Slept like a baby after that fat load.
44243		Just hoodrat location.
44244		Upon arrival and seeing it was an empty, clean, hole in the wall with food hidden in containers instead of displayed, I was a bit hesitant and was disappointed the chicken's not made fresh per order.
44245		I thought i'd died and gone to foodie heaven.
44246		"And some of their combinations left me wishing I could ""do it my way"" more ... and they make a big point of NO SUBSTITUTIONS, which is a shame at such a small place."
44247		She made sure I was happy with the brow shape before she started threading.
44248		Finally, the person that does the ordering came.
44249		We were super patient as we waited almost 20 mins for our waitress to bring water.....water!
44250		I didn't know it was possible to review a sports team on Yelp, and at nearly dead-last place in the league, the Las Vegas Wranglers should get 1 star from me.
44251		The only con is that they don't have high chairs.
44252		I'd recommend Harmony Spa & Salon, just down Rea road for similar prices and amazing work if you're looking for something more affordable.
44253		The only thing I have an issue with is the spice level isn't always the same.
44254		That being said, if I had to complain I would about the price of the steak being different from the one in the menu ($19 to the menu's 16, both without tax).
44255		I have moved now and am going to miss the nice environment and relaxing chairs.
44256		The place didn't have that hipster downtown vibe, bonus!
44257		I wish the owner only good things for this place.
44258		On the other hand, the onion rings were fantastic and meal like due to the thick batter coating each ring.
44259		I told the lady who was doing my nails that it was hot and she laughed it off.
44260		Makes me wonder about the food & products.
44261		I did their job that was supposed to be done before we arrived.
44262		I would eat an entire bowl of just the broth!
44263		I had very slow service the last time I came here but shook it off and popped in before work.
44264		Our server was really nice and sweet.
44265		I arrived fairly early and I think she ran out of bread right after I ordered.
44266		The outside decor was very nice.
44267		Then there's the joy of being nickled and dimed for everything.
44268		The pretzels hawked from baskets, for cash only, are soft, perfectly salty and accompanied by a tangy mustard.
44269		Makes me wish we would have stayed home in the comfort of our own home for this very special event.
44270		Long busy lineups.
44271		($20 per person) Other than that, the restaurant was very big and the servers were quick to clean up our plates.
44272		It was smeared with nutella and marshmallows that had a nice brown color on top.
44273		"The people restrooms were very nice
7."
44274		does not appeal to me, due to both flavor and texture.
44275		I knew immediately I had to find a new place.
44276		The food came out promptly and it looked like something out of a magazine.
44277		Will come back for my next treatment in about 4 months.
44278		I'm going to start off and say I was very excited to come here for dinner considering I live downtown & I am always looking for new spots.
44279		It's a SCAM !
44280		Any idiot knows that your car insurance company most likely covers a rental so don't get their coverage, which usually will exceed the price of your rental on its own.
44281		Keep your eyes focused on the customer and don't roll them when I ask for help.
44282		Self checked in, got a nice room overlooking the roof.
44283		Being serviced by u-haul was the best part of the move.
44284		Scheduling the appointment was easy and I was looking forward to a great experience based on her reviews.
44285		A huge group of young high schoolers came in and grabbed up every seat leaving me and my husband to hold our almost two year old son at a standing table.
44286		It has been my experience at other restaurants that waiters do their best to ignore serving women because they expect a lousy gratuity.
44287		Annoying that they don't have ketchup for the tator tots though
44288		As for the fries I wasn't crazy about them, they should be eaten hot or else their not very good.
44289		Boba balls could be a little sweeter though.
44290		They also had these game systems on the tables.
44291		Only wished that it was more ventilated.
44292		I used to bring my family here frequently about 6 or 7 years ago and it was a great experience.
44293		Sometimes, I go to other restaurants and it takes forever to get Water, or to get anything.
44294		This place is a better Panera Bread/Jason's Deli.
44295		Having said that, some people question these AYCE Sushi joints for the same thing, and I have seen some things that were not good.
44296		"The ""Monkey Bread"" best on earth, the hash, chicken and waffles etc."
44297		"And although the atmosphere is quaint, the quality and attention to detail make you forget you are eating at a largely ""take out style"" restaurant."
44298		Just sad there is no store that is closer than 2,582 miles away (Orange County California) or 2,751 miles away (Summerlin, Nevada).
44299		First of all, my vest was noticeably lighter in color and had white streaks.
44300		When I had a tree fall on my car I was in between work contracts and insurance wouldn't cover all of the damages.
44301		$8 pitchers of beer, $2 cocktails (decent Captain Morgan not completely off the cheap truck brand) and food was also very cheap.
44302		Highest prices.
44303		Not even a sorry for messing up my order.
44304		Back in the day as Terribles this never happened.
44305		A couple of things came out a little extra salty and the way they prepare their michelada isn't one of my faves.
44306		After  an accident (by us) that resulted in the table to jolt forward and drench everything in wine and water - including me!
44307		- There are no free snacks.
44308		So, if you don't like raw, breath-killing onions, order without.
44309		My actual rating for Wurst is easily a 5 (it's amazing), but when I heard the name and the concept I was REALLY, REALLY hoping that they had one of my favourite German dishes.
44310		Not sure if she was having a bad day or what, but I had never had anyone in a drive thru talk to me the way she did.
44311		If you like greek/middle eastern food you are doing yourself a disservice by not eating here.
44312		The next time I went to a very popular place in Korean town (which is where all my Asian friends get their hair done), but they didn't do a good job at it, although cheaper.
44313		Raw meat served to me today.
44314		Cheap for what you get - the sauce was AMAZZZZIIINNNGGG!!!
44315		Since we cant pick up our stuff until three days prior it makes it hard to not take what she gives you being that the event is days away.
44316		If your date is too high maintenance to stand in line for a hot-dog -maybe it wouldn't work out anyway?
44317		The queso fundido, well, melted cheese!
44318		If I lived here I'd go back until I worked my way through their entire menu.
44319		Grilled squid was cheap and way more than we expected.
44320		Hell yeah, and that person was me.
44321		We took a tour and the community seemed nice enough.
44322		RACIST!!
44323		He had his shoes ON TOP OF THE TABLE!
44324		I stopped in because the shop looked interesting from the street.
44325		And no sales pitch for services that you did not want.
44326		At minimum she should have to take that test again!
44327		The only downside is that sometimes when it is busy the wait can be long because they don't allow for reservations.
44328		Don't Even Go There French Toast was BOMB!
44329		The only draw-back is this place is often packed with customers.
44330		Mini doughnuts had me at hello.
44331		The accoutrements were minimal -- some peppers, onions, salsa verde, and a side of guac, nice but made forgettable by my daughter's corn, crab, chili guac (mmm!).
44332		What I am not a fan of are dumbasses with their strollers who stop and stand like deer in headlights for 45 seconds, and then start walking again, so you don't even have enough time to get around them.
44333		I saw some many children running around mad.
44334		By the end of the ride I was sad I didn't book a four hour trip.
44335		I have gone with my boyfriend and my niece on multiple occasions and the people they got weren't as great or personable.
44336		Hopefully they will expand their dining area because it's cramped.
44337		Generally, I love Taco Bell.
44338		I accidentally ordered the wrong roll, but my server was kind enough to let me order something else that I would like more.
44339		Tortilla soup is essentially dressed up vegetable soup - don't bother.
44340		He then sits me down and gives me a jarring explanation on whats going to happen making my nerves rise and my anxiety kick in.
44341		Tim Horton's coffee gives me the runs, no joke.
44342		They put on a new wiper blade on my vehicle, that did not need to be replaced too.
44343		Watch out for some of the tree roots that have bubbled up under the asphalt.
44344		They were able to get my little ones in the following week!
44345		I like that I get the email notification and easy enough to schedule an appointment.
44346		Anyway, the atmosphere of the new location is nice.
44347		Wait, that would be friggin awesome.
44348		My friend loses a PS4, probably in the way truck going to storage place!
44349		The plaza is sketch, the location sucks, but wow.
44350		The wings are terribad.
44351		Imagine a great seafood tomato-based pasta dish and replace the pasta with fresh udon noodles.
44352		The Bleu Brie is just silly.
44353		The only negative is the bathroom situation (make sure you guys check on that every once in a while).
44354		3-course prix fixe menu sounded great.
44355		Finally, she came over and brought us to our table without saying a word or cleaning it off.
44356		You somewhat get this feeling that you are going to have to sit out with everyone which was quite loud.
44357		Least favourite was sparerib dish; it was too dry.
44358		Some servers at other restaurants were noticeably unhappy about the reduced pp check avg.
44359		I have noticed the longevity of the employees that work here and enjoy seeing familiar faces.
44360		There are few friendly attendants in play area to make sure all kids are following rules to prevent injuries.
44361		the only time I did not like it was when we ordered it on New Year's Eve.
44362		Everything wrong with the American diet can be found here.
44363		I think this places's menu looks amazing!
44364		What a change from the last time I was here, the place was absolutely barren.
44365		Bottom Line: Enjoy the show by sitting at the bar.
44366		Heck, it's been featured on the food network!
44367		They put them under a purgula that you would put in your backyard and it makes the store look pretty sharp.
44368		The combination of an old injury to my tail bone and going through labor gave me limitations at the gym and in everyday life.
44369		It really took the edge off!
44370		I got back home super excited and immediately inhaled the rangoons; you can't really screw those up: it's fried wontons with cream cheese and sweet chili sauce.
44371		I told the guy what i want, he knew it would take way more than 30 min, but he went ahead and quoted me the $60 and said they would take care of me.
44372		I hate that a lot of very authentic Chinese places only takes cash.
44373		The wait has never been more than 5 minutes, not even enough to finish the chapter of whatever book I was currently reading.
44374		Our first time here: They are out of Napkins, Drink Lids, and of all things - ROOT BEER.
44375		The bread was a bit hard to handle with just a spoon and would have appreciated a knife and fork!
44376		The wine shop at the entrance is beautiful and reminiscent of the finest wine shops in Napa.
44377		The fries aren't that good though.
44378		And some of the unpaved paths can get muddy.
44379		So unfortunate...gotta love thieves!
44380		"Pink taco needs to step it up, ""you're in Vegas!"""
44381		Salsa Brava in Flagstaff is excellent.
44382		I can't stress enough how UNREAL the seasoning and herbs tasted.
44383		I just wasn't able to pay with my Visa giftcard that I was given as a gift.
44384		The wait staff is very stand offish and it took me a while to get use to that.
44385		When I mentioned my wife having to walk that far several of the young wise mouths said so what.
44386		My friends and I were in the mood for AYCE Koren BBQ and this place was on my must try list.
44387		We ate dinner here, ordered a salad and chicken, the chicken came out slightly undercooked, we told Jonathan, our waiter, and he took it back.
44388		Portions were kind of very small.
44389		I am a vegetarian and there are enough options available.
44390		(Envy's bone-in ribeye is a touch more juicy and succulent however.)
44391		I was excited to dig in.
44392		Our server even tried to correct a party at another table who said that their order was wrong by bringing them the original ticket which actually showed that the party was right and the server had put in order wrong.
44393		Snails were good.
44394		So I got up just as I did the first location and took my ass to McDonald's.
44395		The only I haven't been too crazy about is the golden curry puffs.
44396		The one negative - cost of wines per glass.
44397		That's not the worst part.
44398		Service was decent and the pizza was good enough for me to come back for some more.
44399		Once my initial trauma had healed, my recovery was hampered by limitations in mobility and pain in the multiple injuries over my torso.
44400		This place really will make you VOMIT
44401		The waitress service was exceptoinal.
44402		"We grabbed cocktails at the bar, which they were excellent ""pours"", we then waited a little longer."
44403		The cheese and toppings are much improved.
44404		I mentioned that sea urchin was difficult for me to hold down.
44405		I know it's always a struggle to get the drive-thru line moving, but it doesn't mean you sacrifice quality control and efficiency.
44406		It's hard to find a good taco place in Scottsdale that isn't completely Americanized.
44407		Instead of giving me the flowers, one of their employees took the flowers home for 4 days.
44408		Thankfully the assistant and the lady at the desk in the afternoon were nice.
44409		He took both rolls back and shortly later I got a phone call with an apology and a discount next time I order.
44410		The guy nods and I'm in, I'm quite happy till this point.
44411		The combination of spice breaded chicken and sweet syrup on top of a delicious waffle was about more than mouth could handle.
44412		We felt like we were invisible.
44413		I moved to NC from Maryland 2 years ago and saw one and was excited!
44414		The cocktails are good.
44415		I do think that some of the girls that work here are bitches though.
44416		If they sold their tortillas by the bulk I'd buy them.
44417		You get 2 hrs to eat and that's plenty.
44418		Britany sounded very sweet on the phone when I booked my appt for a Groupon haircut and deep condition.
44419		All my friends who vape rave on about the place, so I had to trust them.
44420		I said yes Ben, hes a jerk.
44421		You tell them which ingredients you want, they put them all in a bowl, and cook in a soup with your broth of choice.
44422		Regardless, I cleaned my plate.
44423		Dinner reservations were at 7:00 p.m., we were greeted and seated at a table outside with a beautiful view.
44424		Keep in mind that you do not want to use Open Table for a recommendation to this place b/c when we arrived, the hostess could not find our reservations.
44425		And in the past the service was good too- at least 3-4 stars.
44426		We were looking at the menu outside when the cashier came out to offer assistance or recommendations.
44427		Of course they hide behind blame toward the home warranty, but come on!
44428		I went to one other place and Valley Goldmine offered me $100 more!
44429		It's gated and there are always guards in golf carts driving around making sure all is well.
44430		Oh, the good thing that did happen this morning is that the Starbucks next door actually knows how to treat people and they do it with a smile on their face.
44431		On the upside there was a play area so the kids were happy in the end.
44432		We thought the price ($18) was too good to be true--and it was.
44433		Everyone was trying to sell us something we didn't need.
44434		I went back for dinner SAME DAY and also forget everything I ordered and inhaled.
44435		Thank you Xia for not charging me for the extra fork.
44436		If you're going to lack a positive attitude than at least be efficient.
44437		You can use the dipping sauce that is served on the side but theses little babies don't need anything added.
44438		Both Lake Mead AND Rampart Boca park have been out for 3 months now - THREE MONTHS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
44439		The waitress was incredible.
44440		We were excited to try this place out given the press, and the owners' backgrounds.
44441		I'm introduced to Frank, an extremely nice tailor who looks like he knows what he's doing.
44442		So many zoos I've been to have much larger spaces for the animals and the barriers tend to have a more natural feel (I.e.
44443		Anyways she said her co-worker knew how to fix it so they didn't have to wait for owner after all.
44444		They called me when I resting from surgery and needed my rest.
44445		First time I paid attention to My Guy not going to make that mistake again.
44446		This place NAILED it!
44447		So, feeling defeated, I shaved, thinking it would be the first of thousands and thousands of times I'd have to do it again.
44448		Whenever I'm in town, Green has been my standby for a couple of years now for its vegan selections, and this time around I took my family to Nami for the first time.
44449		"It is slightly annoying that they regularly ""reserve"" spots at the bar for the favored customers, and sometimes they don't show up for over an hour+."
44450		Waaaaay better service....and food!!
44451		Can I give it a -5 stars?
44452		No prob!
44453		But wait, it gets better!
44454		I don't want to waste my time or more money in Illinois if I won't like them.
44455		When I first walked in the service was great.
44456		Can be a little pricey depending on what you order
44457		Tea is expensive, that's a fact.
44458		We went to the Golden Corral in Monroeville, Pa last week.
44459		Took my parents for dinner this week and couldn't have been less impressed.
44460		I only wish that they did the same.
44461		My roommate says when she talks to Rachel in person she will flip-flop between being normal to downright mean.
44462		I was so excited she was going to eat I took her to Denny's, the closest breakfast spot.
44463		I have eaten at Mesa Grill before and loved it.
44464		The gnocchi my son had ordered, the hole table couldn't keep there paws off of it!!
44465		I know another boba spot opened down the road from here, but I'll probably be coming to LOFTTI instead!
44466		"(The other ""organic"" shops in the area could learn a lot about merchandising and customer service)."
44467		Use Wow carwash.
44468		Yes, its hard when that buddy works another job and can't come but please call and let the client know.
44469		The pool looked like a resort style and the weight room was nice and updated.
44470		And not IGNORE my daughters needs!!
44471		Used to love it here!
44472		The server came, didn't bother asking us if it was our first time there or if we wanted any recommendations.
44473		The worst experience ever!
44474		"Cons:
* A bit too difficult to find located at the back of a business plaza."
44475		My drop off was around 11am and by 3pm they called letting me know that they were finished.
44476		I saw her kicking her own dog to break up a fight.
44477		I'd eat here weakly if it was in my budget to do so.
44478		Stayed there because my Mom always goes there , well it is cheap stayed 3 nights tower room for $71.
44479		One of those angry customers happily gave me their pass so I could see the skywalk: score!
44480		They sent another installer and cut out the bad pieces and replaced them all AT NO ADDITIONAL COST.
44481		We ordered the orange chicken and the pork chow mein.
44482		Other boba tea shops in Vegas make it too liquidly bland where the pudding breaks apart and dissolves into the drink.
44483		Appetizer came to our table and we had no plates or silverware.
44484		I'll start off by saying the atmosphere is not for everyone.
44485		The table got dark as they blocked out the light from our candle...
44486		Your search, my friend, is finally over!
44487		Even if they are not doing exactly what we want, shouldn't they at least appear to have sympathy?
44488		Planning a wedding and then trying to take care of all the details the day of is overwhelming.
44489		I have had many reflexology massages before, so since she didn't say anything, I took the initiative to to instruct her.
44490		We were stranded at our RV site.
44491		Amazon Local has refunded our purchase amount.
44492		The salad is tossed at the table with a pesto buttermilk dressing to complete your soon to be foodgasm in your mouth.
44493		The gentleman was actually pretty helpful and nice on the phone.
44494		My only complaint is that the categories of the dishes listed on the menu were in Italian.
44495		I was flabbergasted.
44496		Get with the times!!
44497		RIPPING PATIENTS OFF.
44498		Tacos... grose, chicken tacos.... Grose and super spicy, red wine sangria.....
44499		There is nothing fancy or pretentious about Mochanics but their service is second to none.
44500		Please take my word and reach out to her if your hair needs some love!!!
44501		Only one negative comment: the pita is chewy sometimes.
44502		And their bathroom is a SEFLIE HEAVEN!
44503		I literally was in tears, because of the pain from the harder than normal grinding.
44504		I will say that the lady that cleaned my house did a pretty good job(not fantastic).
44505		The guy was very pleasant over the phone and that's as good as it got!
44506		Finally my BF says we don't feel like we should have to pay $40 for crab legs when we didn't get any crab legs.
44507		I know it's just a fast food service, but these people just look through u like invisible.
44508		OUTRAGEOUS HAPPY HOUR PRICING.
44509		I guess I have to go to Trop for wings!
44510		When fajitas first came on the scene years ago, they were tasty, spicy and peppery.
44511		-Finding someone who spoke our language as a primary was impossible and some issues arose from that but also ignorable.
44512		Same quality staff, same quality beers, same quality food, and all in a perfect location at the Homestead Waterfront.
44513		We came for a late dinner and their happy hour menu was off the charts.
44514		I always prefer to work with professional, quality salespeople who can answer all of our questions and follow thru with appointments and the attention that is needed to get the deal done as quickly as possible.
44515		My vehicle was undrivable due to two flat tires.
44516		Finally, my boyfriend is currently in the hospital and cannot stomach the hospital's food.
44517		HOT MESS!
44518		It's fine if you don't know the answer to something, but at least make the effort to find it out!
44519		On a positive note, the kids club is nice!!
44520		I hate anorexic krispy kreme donuts.
44521		Never did they make me feel stupid or pressure me to go one way or another towards any company.
44522		No dead bolt or chain lock like in most other hotel rooms.
44523		Not gonna lie I have driven by this spot for 10 years and always thought it looked dodgy!!
44524		Getting in during peak times is usually a very long wait.
44525		fish portions are half the size they used to be with higher prices.
44526		For me, the best part about this hotel is that there is NO CASINO and it is a NO-SMOKING hotel.
44527		I know I'll come back to try it again.
44528		I decided to try BounceU because i had friends that enjoy their open play.
44529		The busboy who brought our food dropped the containers of jam onto the floor, picked them up, stacked them back in their little holder and put them onto our table.
44530		Maria has an attitude.
44531		Luckily, I live close by and grab some nicer shoes and it met the bouncer's approval.
44532		booo burger king !
44533		First off , let me start by saying that staff at Charleston Coffee House were very accommodating.
44534		Since it was such a beautiful day, my friend and I took a ride and stopped for an Iced Tea and Fries.
44535		But I still got hung up on.
44536		If I ever need anything plumbing-related, I will definitely contact Coyote Plumbing and Rooter.
44537		For the foreseeable future, I'll be taking a slightly longer drive for substantially better pizza.
44538		Don't have this ingredient, don't have that don't have this.
44539		The only thing I don't recommend getting done there is an eyebrow wax.
44540		If you want a chill afternoon with cool people then I'd recommend bringing your suit and hanging out at Spanish Fly.
44541		Ice Now has a 400 pound limit which is $70.
44542		This gym is always packed in the mornings.
44543		From early in the day to night experiences, from people finding a bandages or tissue in their food to a friend of mine going into the kitchen himself to grab a pitcher of water for our table.
44544		Sometimes the TV doesn't work, but luckily the walls are so thin you can just tune in to your neighbors program.
44545		My kids love the Pho.
44546		The placed hacked me up.
44547		They will tell you what you want to hear, then give you something totally different in person.
44548		Aisles are tight, I wouldn't bring a stroller in here.
44549		I was gobsmacked by the number of people who gave him encouragement, help, and even money, but discipline needs to come from within.
44550		Well we didn't and thank you the T & M Automotive for being honest.
44551		But I just can't get passed the way Peter treated me when I checked in for my appointment.
44552		Even though there was a full house, we only say and waited maybe 2 minutes at most.
44553		The only issue I've ever had with these swanky hotels is the bathroom - can I some more privacy please!!
44554		This is the place where all the rejects go when they can't get into a real club.
44555		WHen she was done with the polish she she wiped my hands with a warm towel and clipped the cuticles on my thumbs!
44556		He comes after me, commanding me to sit back down and 'negotiate like a man'.
44557		The last one is more of an annoyance, but our management team is constantly shilling product for our residents.
44558		And yet another exchange today due to...issues.
44559		The A/C tech.
44560		But the icing on the cake is that when I got my car, they hurried me along so I pull into the parking lot to inspect my car.
44561		Our car was broken into and hundreds of dollars worth of stuff stolen.
44562		Fresh cut fries were good.
44563		One drawback is that they close kind of early.
44564		We chose to share the carnitas taquitos, which was a good idea because the portion was definitely too much for one person.
44565		The brakes are just fine and those jerks at North Scottsdale Volkswagen are theives!
44566		I mean come on RAW CHICKEN!
44567		It is a quick-service restaurant with a full-service atmosphere.
44568		"Portions are big and prices are
very fare."
44569		They can be a bit messy to eat.
44570		I live in California and have very bad Lexus dealerships(way overpriced)!
44571		Please patronize Angelina's, don't let the Ma & Pa Joints we love falter...we NEED to support our favorite independent local establishments...
44572		The other alarming part of all of this is, the two women talked in depth about the cleanliness of other salons and about how dirty they were and what kind of infections you could get.
44573		The woman that styled my hair was done in 5 minutes, not even taking the time to do it nicely.
44574		After being in pain for a month I went to a professional doctor and got diagnosed and treated within 10 minutes.
44575		Called to ask if i could exchange it , they said sure and would send another one over.
44576		Next time I wouldn't order just because you can get seafood anywhere.
44577		We stood in line for one 3D event for over an hour and the even took just 2 minutes.
44578		This seems a little pricy for the atmosphere since it isn't a sit down restaurant.
44579		But I was admittedly impressed with my scalding hot fresh cakes, consdering that this place is always empty, and they always seem to have a tonne ready made.
44580		That being said, I feel like this place has gone downhill a little bit.
44581		Wouldn't even try it.
44582		She personally examined it and determined it was a rare, flawed construction.
44583		She looked at the comb and said it was of good quality and that it would stay.
44584		My friends and I went into this establishment at 3 am we had just came in from out of town and were excited to have our first drink.
44585		The only thing better than the decor was the food itself.
44586		uggggg, I had to put the seat down!
44587		"Her mother pitched a fit because back then, it was ""not a good area""."
44588		Both of the girls working treated me heinously from the instant we approached the counter.
44589		They waited for my son to go in a restaurant and immediately towed his car.
44590		The sweet girl who signed me up promised a bed upgrade and a free spray tan if I did a month to month contract and bought a  bottle of lotion.
44591		We got tired of Adrian's and Vocelli's and one slice of meat on their hoagies.
44592		The best is pigeon.
44593		The other 2 Steve said were in great shape.
44594		I think this is a great scheme to increase their revenue.
44595		Only negative is that they use Hunts ketchup.
44596		The drinks were getting low and she made sure they were full.
44597		Sad but true.
44598		Yes, it is a bit pricey and I would go a lot more if it weren't so much.
44599		The artists were friendly and the place was clean.
44600		"In fact, it was the crew member who brought my mother the redone soup and gave us the same ""it's not our fault speech"" when we asked her questions."
44601		I used to like El Jefe and want them to succeed.
44602		She says you should go to the one on McQueen and Pecos, and she is, as usual, right.
44603		When they brought our food out, they came back with an extra side of eggs because they werent sure if hers got cold while they were preparing the rest.
44604		Then never poured one more drop for the whole meal.
44605		"I asked for a corporate number or a higher up and he said ""find it online"" !"
44606		"The Good
The employees I encountered were polite and professional."
44607		That is why I usually don't go to Mexican restaurants, as they just load things with cheese, fat and some kind of tortilla and call it Mexican.
44608		Not to mention, the product now being provided at this establishment is half the size and double price of the wings at surrounding restaurants.
44609		We parked there along with everyone else.
44610		Lots of ice and little coffee.
44611		No excuses for the delay in service.
44612		There's usually only one cashier who takes the orders so the wait can be long.
44613		No problem with that because we didn't get any.
44614		Since I've moved here (10 years ago) I've been continuously disappointed and left feeling ripped off for over paying for bad food.
44615		Beware, the read salsa is stright poison!
44616		I ate the banana bread & it was fine.
44617		We ate and stacked the trays and started talking a lady came and picked up the trays and said with attitude pick up those pickles.
44618		My room smells like smoke and it's non-smoking!
44619		Slightly hipster, totally tatsty.
44620		"Frankly it couldn't be further from ""fine""."
44621		If you're looking for Thai on a ramen budget, I recommend Thai Basil on University Dr.
