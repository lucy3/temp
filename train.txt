159	pos	I heard all about his kids and grandkids private schools.
160	neg	However, this past September, the pain would not go away after my usual Aleve in the morning and night.
161	neg	Based on the personal attacks I've read toward some of their employees, I'd say their customer base is the problem.
162	pos	Seriously, there was not a bit of lobster less than an inch thick in there.
163	pos	... definitely left full and did not eat till the next day!
164	pos	I saw this one, with the 4.5 stars and that it was right across the street from our hotel (Marriott) and thought it was a good choice.
165	pos	They eventually figured out which box was mine and replaced the corroded lock free of charge.

167	pos	2) The nail file and buffer were clearly well used.
168	pos	God bless the waitresses, they were doing the best they could.
169	pos	The first time I tried their pizza, their tomato was amazing.

171	neg	So many times food is ruined by the overuse of salt.

175	neg	Would not recommend for something looking for a nice stroll in nature or a quick hike (less than 4 hours).
176	pos	She's worth giving a tip for as much as she charges for the cut.
177	neg	As noted in other reviews it is small but I've been to larger places and felt like I wasted my time and my money.
178	pos	Right when I think I am in the best shape possible, I leave it to Joe to give me a reality check!
179	neg	The guys at Auto Haus actually checked it out on their computer, and found it was set at only 40%.
180	neg	They only ask you if you want insurance on your electronic, and wouldn't let you know that you can't return the giftcard that you purchase at their store!
181	pos	My boyfriend and I were excited to try this place and had been talking about it for days.
182	neg	Came here to study and first they have a limited amount of seating and those they were available    were the cubicle which gives you some privacy but not comfortable.
183	pos	They give you champagne.
184	neg	The charges just keep on coming!
185	neg	This USED to be our families go to place!
186	pos	Finally we received three correct orders plus a pecan pie.
187	neg	I read a lot of gripe about how expensive this place is and was afraid I'd be spending a fortune (they dont have prices listed on their sample menus on the website).
188	neg	So they re made it really quickly and gave me what I ordered with a side of cold hash browns.
189	neg	I would not return for the $395 menu, but maybe one of the smaller meals, and hopefully be able to get a ride to the mansion next time.
190	pos	The food took a long time to be served but it was worth the wait.
191	neg	"If they points you out, you need to go!"""
192	pos	By the end of dinner, everyone's plate was empty.
193	pos	(Seriously, try to say no to all the cute home stuff when it's 50% off AND you have a 30% off coupon!)
194	neg	Towards the end of our dinner we had to ask the other waitress who had been helping us all night, since Lourdes was nowhere to be found, to have them sing HBD to my niece and bring the ice cream.
195	pos	My second time here and thought I have finally found a home for my lil girl.
196	neg	And to the people giving low stars based on chicken teriyaki, or that the screaming orgasm doesn't come with rice...animals don't deserve to die to be eaten by you.
197	neg	I can't judge their in store dining.
198	neg	The deviled eggs were a little bland.
199	neg	During my other visit, I had placed an order through the app but dropped in a bit late and my drink had gone bad.
200	neg	I don't know if I'm irritated that they thought of it first, or that they are charging that much for a piece of furniture they probably paid $20 bucks for, slapped some white paint on it then scratched it up to make it look old.
201	neg	When we moved into our house the windows had not been cleaned in literally years on top of several severe dust storms, so they were the worst.
202	neg	spice level on food is always a bit skewed in Arizona i ordered Thai Fried Rice with star rating of 4 out of 5 and for me it was more like a 2. non the less flavor was right on point.
203	pos	As you're going up to the Visitor's Center (which I would highly recommend on checking out), you have to pay a $7 entrance fee.
204	pos	Oh but he did mention that he can guarantee all the pieces in the shop today are genuine.
205	neg	Geez!
206	pos	They have bags and bags of them waiting next to the register.
207	pos	A few moments later, the food runner brought a burger back to us.
208	pos	There are few times when I leave a restaurant without having an ounce of constructive criticism for the establishment but this was certainly the case with our dining experience at Pamika Brasserie.
209	pos	The bartender also made me a pineapple mojito that wasn't on the menu.
210	neg	Saying goodbye is already stressful and unwelcome.
211	pos	While not the cheapest - I was told their quality of work and customer service makes up for that.

2474	neg	My only qualm with the establishment is that it can take a bit long to get your drink if there's a line.
2475	pos	The fries beneath the top layer in most poutines are soggy, these were crispy the whole way through and flavour-flavour-flavour!

2544	pos	I can't say I'm too adventurous with the menu- I've never had the philly steaks or pizza because to me the only natural accompaniment to the fries are the Super Dogs (their incredible bounce-back-when-you-bite-into-them hot dogs with cheese and bacon).
2545	neg	They had a small parking lot and very limited seating (just a few outdoor picnic benches).
2546	pos	After work i liked coming here in South Point.

2558	pos	You can stroll in around 12, indulge in some samples, and realize you don't really need lunch.
2559	neg	A couple of servers have put their hands all over my waffle when preparing it (ew) and the plastic cutlery just seems cheap and shoddy (not to mention it's really hard to cut your waffle when you're using plastic knives).
2560	pos	I love potatoes!
2561	pos	I pre-booked my appointment because I am a loyal client and that is what I do every time.
2562	pos	3 stars for the room.
2563	pos	The only weakness of this place is the snack selection -- what can I say, I like to one-stop-shop when I rent a movie and take care of my snackables in the same place!
2564	pos	"I didn't get a crazy sales pitch I didn't get someone who blew me off because ""the phone was ringing""."
2565	pos	The service was good and so was the lemonade
2566	pos	This place is on our list for frequent return visits.

2581	pos	One thing - they do make their drinks strong.
2582	pos	It's not amazing, but at least the staff is friendly and willing to help.
2583	pos	Not many restaurants on Yelp have a full 5 star rating after 100+ reviews.
2584	pos	Excited to see the Lobster Truck at Smiths today at 12:30.
2585	pos	The staff was pretty friendly and I went during an off time so it was pretty empty and most importantly...it was cheap.
2586	pos	I swear up and down that establishments housing gargantuan menus can't be good, and so far I am being proven wrong.

2659	neg	And this is coming from someone who has been with several staffing agencies which all told me what I wanted to hear, but never followed through.

2674	neg	The drawback, its very loud and very crowded which keeps this place in business, so its good for business.

2805	pos	You probably won't be disappointed with the food, is what I'm saying.
2806	neg	Because their cupcakes are lopsided affairs, the icing sagging to one side like an old Baltimore lady with a stiff bouffant, and almost all the flavor is in the icing.

3356	neg	Our bill was extremely hefty for the wine and food.

3359	neg	Very hard to see,
3360	pos	The Wifi was free and fast enough to watch Netflix in HD on my laptop.

3363	pos	The interior is much better, with lots of cultural decorations.

3370	neg	His lack of professionalism and argumentative demeanor far exceeded hers!
3371	pos	Although my insurance changed(job) Dr. Keller recommended another Doctor that took the insurance I had.

3373	pos	There even is a toilet there with its own stall and a telephone .
3374	pos	At that time, the patties weren't flaky (which I think is one of the most important qualities of a good patty).

3376	neg	As pointed out in another review, at the moment they are only open until 7:00 PM.

3381	neg	I will agree with one of the other reviewers that the service can be spotty.
3382	neg	"Then Instructor Bill offers his opinion to my 6'6"" boyfriend that maybe I'd be happier if I were shoe shopping."

3386	pos	Very knowledgeable and friendly.
3387	pos	They had very knowledgable and friendly staff and amazing food.
3388	pos	As for the drop off, we simply pulled in, signed that we were returning the car, and we were done.

3410	neg	Wow.....now I'm just speechless...mostly because I'm hungry, and pissed, and afraid I might spontaneously combust at this point.
3411	neg	To start, there is nothing too appealing or noticeable about the outside so you would probably have to know of the place before you come.
3412	pos	There was a crowd of people waiting to be seated and since it was just three of us we were seated first!
3413	pos	I'm normally not the type to pop and crack, but this therapist had my spine cracking all over.

3443	neg	I wasn't thrilled with the 3rd choice.
3444	pos	Left a good review for Destihl a couple months ago.
3445	neg	The restaurant is kind of small, so there could be a wait if you go there during the weekend at a busy time.
3446	neg	For better dumplings, you'll need to go to China.
3447	neg	Even the honey for the biscuit came in the small package tube.

4416	pos	The place was OK!
4417	neg	And the day of we didn't have them remake it because my husband didn't want to leave again during the game to go get it ... and they were so busy I don't think they wanted to remake it anyways.

4438	neg	The weight room can get tight during peak hours, so keep that in mind.
4439	neg	Their burger was okay and maybe too much hype about their burgers made with sauce from animals or something.
4440	pos	One really awesome thing about this place is that you are told to eat the sushi with your hands?
4441	pos	I called 15-20 minutes after we left, the employee who answered the phone checked everywhere for me, while on the phone with me.
4442	neg	Due to my late flight, service was closed.

4447	pos	Wasn't too busy when I went there, but give it a few months to catch on and I'm sure it'll be mobbed.

4469	pos	We are done with our treatments and we are going to miss everyone.

4471	neg	Hard to really screw that up I would think?
4472	neg	Spent an hour on the phone twice over it.
4473	pos	When snobby foodie friends hype a place up chances are they are right and this time was no exception.

4485	pos	It does not matter to us that western Europeans see us as Eurotrash or that Cleveland is made fun of by those living on either coast.. We are going to keep on dancing to our own music.
4486	neg	Get it together hot dog place!!!
4487	pos	The inside of the restaurant is dark but decorated in a way that makes it more clubby than dismal.
4488	neg	We ate on the patio and there was one smoker who appeared to be walking to the pool nearby that was bad for ambiance so, recommend eating inside.
4489	neg	Although, the omlette was sort of flavourless, definetly not their strong point.
4490	pos	I think I was the most excited person to see this coming to Avon.

4515	pos	It started pouring outside right before the desserts, so we were escorted inside, and even saw the owner walk patrons to their car while carrying a patio umbrella so that they wouldn't be drenched!
4516	neg	This was not acceptable for me, as I could not leave my cat caged for two weeks straight.
4517	neg	Looks closed from the outside but it's not.
4518	pos	Awesome news right?
4519	neg	One of my rolls even came out in flames.

4534	pos	I'm always asked how I'm doing by at least 2-3 employees down the line, no matter how busy it is.
4535	pos	My sister-in-law ordered the Southwestern Salad.
4536	pos	They called me when they figured out what was wrong to get authorization, they called me as soon as my car was ready so I didn't make any trips out there for no reason, they also called to know if I was picking it up that night or if they should pull it it.
4537	pos	We sat on the patio and were greeted pretty quickly and given menus.
4538	neg	Amateur hour all around.
4539	neg	The particular car that I wanted was not located on the lot at the time.

4549	pos	The manager did contact me and offered me another experience ON THEM.
4550	pos	The wait time for your food is about five minutes, which I think is pretty acceptable seeing as how it's made to go.
4551	neg	Online it is so I won't spread germs to everyone else or sit in an uncomfortable chair when I already don't feel good.
4552	neg	I mean, they could have atleast told me that they were behind on patients or something...Again, doctors-GREAT, Staff-HORRIBLE!

4565	neg	About the only negative I can think of is they don't have a digital display of which orders are ready like the Oracle location, and the loudspeaker is hard to hear because it echos throughout the building.

5518	pos	On a side note, since the food itself was actually good, if you're like a lot of people and this is really where you and your friends are going to spend your entire evening and have some drinks and what not, you might not have any problem with this particular place.

5588	neg	Both are disgusting compared to Abuelos.
5589	pos	Suduiraut hit their target with the Lions (lighter, brighter, and probably best drunk young), but a classic Sauternes like Chateau Suduiraut or even a second like Carmes de Rieussec would have paired much better.

5972	pos	If I had a cool burger joint this is exactly how I would have decorated it.
5973	neg	The total bill was $48, which was quite expensive for lunch for two, but like I said, we ordered way too much food, considering it was lunchtime.
5974	pos	If you're a french food fanatic, and haven't been to Paris 66... You're missing out.
5975	neg	I was actually looking forward to this dish, but it seems odd and out of place once you get it, and it was gross.

5986	pos	We were immediately handed legs of lamb as we stepped inside.

7606	pos	I also tried the Banana Foster ($18), it was delicious but not what I expected.
7607	neg	Continued to argue that they could not run our individual tickets due to 'how much time it would take', and once I (unfortunately, I had to be a little more aggressive) asserted that I did not open a tab and wanted my card to be ran, they complied and it took less than a minute.

7624	neg	Mens selection is a bit smaller.

9288	pos	I believe that some other companies may have just simply tried to upsell me a whole new opener for probably a few hundred dollars; not Joey!
9289	neg	It might be a drive for me to take our cars to Crawford's, it might be a pain to arrange for rides to and fro.

9306	neg	The one complaint I have, and I didn't think this warranted dropping a star necessarily, was that I had pre-ordered and pre-paid for our shirts when we bought the tickets... when we got there, the only sizes available were medium and small, so none of the guys on our team got shirts.
9307	neg	A little small on the portion size and a little costly for the small size....

9334	pos	At one point I was being served faster than I could drink the three beers in front of me.
9335	pos	Lmfao!

10177	pos	Good way to keep people playing.
10178	neg	Strangely, having worked in restaurants all throughout highschool and college and grad school, I think that's a simple management attitude problem (I've seen some really good and really bad management, while wait staffs are pretty much always the same--gotta set the bar high and get the basics right!).
10179	pos	Our food came out quickly, and the restaurant was clean.
10180	neg	Avoid during lunch hours if you are in a hurry.

10231	pos	Add to that my Grandfather retired from GM after 30 years and you can see there is some loyalty there.
10232	neg	Example: you order one of everything and you eat 1/4 of your order, you will be charged $10.99 per pound for everything you didn't eat.
10233	neg	Waiting forever.

10252	pos	And that's not even the best part.
10253	pos	The persian food here is reasonably good.
10254	neg	I drove up an hour before they closed with the most filthiest car ever.

11603	pos	"Rupe Rankings of note:
- #1: crave factor
- #1: signature sandwich (hotdog)
- #1: beer selection
- #2: pizza
- #2: fries

Menu recommendations:
- chili cheese dog
- scorpassi (kielbasa with jalapenos)
- garden pizza
- plain fries
- any brew you haven' t had or from blue point, ommegang or bell's

Why you would go:
- 1000+ bottled beers on hand for on-premise consumption or customized 6-pack creation
- 30-40 brews on tap for pints or take-away growlers
- awesome pub food
- miller lite for cheap (in the new fully-stocked upstairs bar)
- roll-up doors on the restaurant side for quasi-outdoor seating

Why you wouldn't go:
- with a larger group (more than 4 people)
- seeking a quiet evening spot for kids (afternoons are fine for kids)
- unwilling to pay the premium for micro / craft / import brews
- unable to parallel park

Overall impression:
Terriffic neighborhood place for a small group to grab some terribly unhealthy food and try some new beers."

But it's so expensive that I put it on LAYAWAY
Then I ran round back and ate it all in the ALLEYWAY
Then posted this review a few hours after XMAS DAY

I saved up my pennies, but not for a RAINY DAY
And eventually I went back to CzuchRAJ TO PAY
I ran in to LeBron, when I was ON THE WAY
And he gave me a ride, in a tricked out CHEVROLET

We drank wine all night, I think it was BEAUJOLAIS
And then King James asked me if I'd go ALL THE WAY
To Akron... his hometown... and who was I to DISOBEY
And that's when he told me who really killed JFK

I can't tell you what he said, at least not on BOXING DAY
But like Ari and her man, me and LBJ talk ERRYDAY
He just asked me if I wanna go to his manSION TO PLAY
(Bball) (and he said his eggs are bigger than FABERGE)

But that's TMI and I don't kiss & tell ANYWAY
And if I did I bet I'd Collide with a lawsuit like HOWIE DAY
I'm so glad that I went back to WSM to SQUARE AWAY
For all that luscious Jerky that I bought from J & J 

WHAT

12667	pos	"Hella cheap

12674	pos	Yay for local bars in Las Vegas!!!
12675	pos	They also had 4 or 5 different teas brewed in the store to try while I waited for my tea to be expertly made and when they handed me my tea it was always double cupped, told me exactly how many minutes to wait before taking the tea bag out, and even let me know that if I brought the bag back (promotion for the holidays) I could receive a free tea!
12676	pos	I'm not sure that the prices complaint is still valid (the worst reviews seem older) as costs here for the food and beverages are completely in line with the location.

12684	neg	And I'm sorry for waffling so much.
12685	pos	My kids were super excited and I have to admit, as a huge Marvel fan, I was too.
12686	pos	It's a little late but I just never got the chance to give credit where credit is due.
12687	pos	I started going there as it was close, I kept going there for the service, food and value.

12700	pos	I've never seen a woman that works there and I've never had an issue with anyone they're either so I'm assuming they've gotten a new staff.
12701	pos	The pulled pork lacked a lot of flavor but this could be because I enjoyed the brisket so much.
12702	neg	This is a true, dingy, dive bar of a pub.

12704	pos	I think I've literally eaten everything on it.
12705	pos	It was pure heaven, juicy tender just really good.

12720	neg	I just wish they weren't on the opposite side of town for me.
12721	pos	And now I am off to take a nap from my glorious food coma.
12722	neg	the one near decatur used to the spot to go to back when i was in high school over ten years back, but their service and food quality, alongside sanitation and health have depleted and i avoid going there now because it just feels unclean.

12757	pos	First of all, I have to say that the receptionist was very nice and I was able to book an appt.

12771	neg	Sometime general tao is hit and miss, with some restaurants creating sauces that are all sugar and almost translucent.
12772	neg	Nothing worse than a snotty host who ignores you until you ask for service.
12773	pos	I thought they would wash my car, but they did way more than wash my car.
12774	pos	And the wings, I throw down myself at home, hot, lemon pepper, teriyaki, spicy garlic.....whatever flavor I can make that right at home!

12776	neg	The pizza can improve a bit.
12777	pos	Lien spent about 2 hours on just my manicure, and while it could have been because it was a slow Tuesday, I think it was because she really just wanted to take her time and do things right.

13804	pos	My food definitely had some heat.
13805	neg	Cattle ranch is a little tricky because the street its on is not very lit, in a neighborhood and there is a small sign in the drivway that says circus of illusion that canbe easily missed.

13807	neg	So much garlic.

13820	pos	Sushi/food and service was great then.
13821	pos	There were no surprises.
13822	pos	But the reps did every thing in their power to make it better and really, isn't that what great customer service is about.

13857	neg	Your client should always get your attention 100% of the appointment.
13858	pos	The remodel after Buttita's is as good as one can do when turning a lovely restaurant into a sports bar-style restaurant (though why one would want to do that is beyond me).

14788	neg	Be careful they are going off the other people's reviews but the good people moved!
14789	neg	I've had some pretty bad experiences getting my makeup done, and I preferred not to look like Tina Turner on my wedding day.

14885	pos	Must try for the experience.

14944	neg	Gas stations would stock them but who knows how long they would be sitting there.

15070	neg	The delivery came exactly at 3, despite the fact that they are literally across the street.
15071	neg	For time-share owners, you might have some problems as the ownership of the tower went from Westgate to Hilton, causing issues almost always when it comes to reservations.

15099	neg	My body hurt for two days afterward, bros.

15114	neg	In addition, we got to listen to some other stories that made both my friend and I raise a few eyebrows.
15115	pos	It had steak and some potato and whatever dressing they used was to die for.
15116	pos	That should have been enough but their dessert menu is filled with too much to just end the experience here.
15117	neg	I asked a question and got a blunt answer.
15118	neg	The store had no organization whatsoever, and most of the aisles were bare, as far as accessories and apparel were concerned anyway.
15119	pos	I choose them from a slue of others from Home Advisor because they were family owned and veterans; as am I.
15120	neg	(they had no flavor).
15121	neg	I postponed the reservation once and then we still showed up late because Greater Cleveland suddenly remembered that we had a thriving downtown area and descended en masse on downtown for the lighting ceremonies downtown, the snow event at Progressive Field, and the Cavs game all at once, which meant that we had problems finding parking.
15122	pos	Quite the show they are running at Handy.
15123	neg	We've ordered from other neighboring places before... And those have not really worked out.
15124	neg	The guy that signed me up and my personal trainer were the only two people that seemed to know what they were doing.
15125	pos	Some cool hipster art on the walls, but again, it's simple and they let the food be the most important thing in the room.
15126	neg	Today's visit was prompted by The Tablet attempting an ill advised feat of aerobatics which resulted in a very unhappy screen.

15136	pos	They also have vents at each table, so don't worry about leaving out of there smelling like you just left a BBQ pit.
15137	neg	Nearby parking is limited.
15138	pos	There were many affordable options on the menu, you could get out for much less...but miss out of trying a ton of tastiness.
15139	neg	Tried to place an online order while driving but this location doesn't show up yet.
15140	neg	Few items damaged even though it was properly packed and rapped.
15141	pos	The place was busy, but we were seated immediately and the food was served incomprehensibly fast.

15145	neg	I passed out!!!
15146	pos	We had fun.
15147	pos	The first 3 appointments I had were with Rochelle, they were pretty good and Rochelle is just the sweetest person you could meet.

15164	neg	I wasn't crazy about the roast beef, but don't let that discourage you.
15165	pos	Yes the driver was very decent.
15166	pos	So far it has been great and we've been there 4-5 times.
15167	pos	The place seems to be pretty dead around the dinner hour, making it potentially a nice place to get a little work done.
15168	pos	I love Chipotle.
15169	pos	Smiling, friendly ...
15170	neg	If you read my first review I didn't have such a stellar experience, It wasn't bad per say but it wasn't what I was expecting!

15178	pos	Thank you 1-800 Water Damage!
15179	pos	!...........I have been shopping at Smith's both in Utah and Nevada for 20yrs....That's 20yrs at the rate of $150-$200 every 2weeks......That's $75k-$100k worth of business.
15180	pos	I love how the washroom had  lots of tissues and toilet paper for escaping to cry and blow my nose.
15181	pos	It's not only the food that people like but the experience and customer service that they receive when they come into a business.

15183	neg	Plastic chairs?

15185	pos	As previously said we requested a high floor back in 2013 and we were placed there no fuss, no qualms.

17242	pos	The bathroom is usually where you see the most wear and tear, but not here.
17243	neg	Which was a key question, because if I walked out of there with just a thin line, I would of freaked!
17244	pos	One employee even pulls out chairs to offer a seat.
17245	pos	It's all served out of one sketchy looking bar in a shack, but that just adds to the old times vibe of getting ice cream.
17246	pos	It's really nice.
17247	pos	The security guard (beard & hat) in his nicest voice stated to my husband that he couldn't get into El Hefe because he had on high top sneakers.
17248	neg	The bar was crowded and understaffed, leading to a bit of a wait for a drink.
17249	pos	I had raved about your food.
17250	neg	Sooo unprofessional his name is Jav and I didn't notice her name.
17251	neg	What an inconvenience as a parent who wants to stay in shape.
17252	neg	If you want a hot, to-go cappuccino you might as well go to Starbucks with the rest of the mouth breathing, robusta-drinking, non-fair trading, multiple-sourcing, GMO-endorsing cretins.
17253	pos	I now currently go to a different med spa and it is like night and day.
17254	neg	So we somehow acquired the roommate from hell.
17255	pos	We were lucky enough to get a patio spot with a big TV.
17256	pos	By the way, my co-workers, friends, and strangers on the street stop me to ask me about my nails.
17257	neg	With five months to go, I was very wrong.
17258	neg	Chiropractors make me nervous.
17259	neg	Restaurant Rescue needs to visit ASAP!
17260	neg	He also stated that the chicken tortilla soup can get that way if it is not made right and should have not gone out that way.
17261	pos	So I was anticipating a great job, based on the reviews!
17262	neg	We didn't like the drinks, but Tony took them off the menu.
17263	pos	Like wow..
17264	pos	Hotel was awesome.
17265	neg	"There seemed to be only 1 employee there and he didn't seem like manager cause when I asked for his name he seemed nervous 
I asked for his name for this specific review , all thought Taco Bell was packed!!!!"
17266	neg	After waiting forever to get my glasses I eventually got them.
17267	neg	When the other dealership we had been going to changed hands, the service staff changed and we didn't like how we were treated.
17268	neg	We should have stopped ordering at the enchiladas.
17269	neg	It did turn out to be an installation problem (stupid cousin!)
17270	pos	I'm glad we weren't so close up.
17271	neg	There are so many issues and such a short space to write here.
17272	pos	They did this in front of us and it seemed a bit pretentious but i can forgive anything if it tastes good!
17273	pos	He has assured me that a game plan is in place to improve service; I look forward to seeing the improved results.
17274	pos	This is one of the shows you don't want to fall asleep because you don't want to miss a move and wonder how the heck he just did that.
17275	neg	"Cuz I already know meat eaters look at us vegetarians crazy when we go someplace OBVIOUSLY meat-affiliated then want to complain, ""There's nothing here for me to eat!"""
17276	pos	The best item we ate from there and definitely worth the extra $1!
17277	neg	Thanks SCOTT I have no car now and I owe the bank $9,000.
17278	neg	There isn't much place to sit, but some seats by the window, enough for maybe 20 people.
17279	pos	This place is becoming an addiction for me.
17280	pos	I had a few and it was very rare to hear anything (I lived on the first floor).
17281	pos	What great customer service!
17282	pos	They made it to my speed dial and not everyone makes it there!
17283	pos	Not sure which was better, the food or the service.
17284	pos	Went here for summerlicious last night.
17285	pos	Only eating here for thair food for now on!
17286	neg	We let without eating or waiting.
17287	neg	Very hard to hold a conversation.
17288	neg	Oh, and if you're going on a weekend day, be prepared to wait, because you very well may have to -- especially if it's later in the day/evening.
17289	neg	The only complaint I have about this place is when they turned on their red neon window light half way through hour session.
17290	neg	When searching for the cable we found an open and recently used personal lubricant.

17296	pos	"Much cheaper and more effective and advised by the person who stood to profit the most from ""selling"" me something more than I needed- the owner's wife."

17299	pos	My sensitive skin has taken a beating at many other places but never here.
17300	neg	Suck it up or get carry out.
17301	neg	It was way too much for one person to eat.
17302	neg	You get great prices and exceptional food except the service is horrible.
17303	neg	They were great but that price isn't worth it and I wouldn't do it again.
17304	neg	Only because this entree comes with two sauces for dipping and the bun would get too spongey.
17305	pos	Got there around 7:30 and told there was a twenty to thirty minute wait which was fine with me because I can always shop, but we were seated within ten minutes.
17306	pos	We had a very good experience at the Vegas location.
17307	neg	And don't think just because any other gym would have nice people working there that these people are nice.
17308	neg	I prefer the weekdays for lunch where half of it isn't breakfast food because breakfast food just fills you up too fast and then you don't feel like you truly got your money's worth.
17309	pos	"Thanks for considering Petagree."""
17310	neg	A little upscale and pricey!
17311	pos	Definitely a repeater.
17312	pos	Woo hoo!
17313	pos	The rest of the show was great, Recover (also from Austin) was incredible (in less than 30 minutes), and Further played really well but of course the bubble bursting of Pop Unknown was all anyone wanted to talk about.
17314	neg	Beware: their online menu is missing several items that are in the dine in menu.
17315	pos	"Perfect date spot, go bowling, movies, grab a treat here..

Now for the reason for the horrible score."
17316	pos	When on vacation I will never sacrifice another meal in Las Vegas.
17317	pos	I think I'm heading back there after wrapping up this review...which is about now.

17319	neg	Skip the curry quinoa.
17320	pos	Got what i wanted, got cash back as well, standard gas station with a standard car wash.
17321	pos	Hah..a rhyme every time.
17322	pos	When in Vegas, make sure you come to dine at chart house restaurant in Fremont.
17323	pos	In our party of six, we had dietary restrictions for one person (who was vegan) and made this clear in a phone call beforehand - to which they said was no problem.
17324	neg	"Awesome

I would like to add an addendum:
The harassing comments I am getting from troll accounts from this business are astounding."
17325	neg	Food is alway good - service seems to always take an hour to get something - go to over easy across the street, they seem to get staffing right.
17326	neg	We couldn't really see the menu to begin with but once we repositioned and used our phone lights we managed to make it out.
17327	neg	So many places are too noisy.
17328	pos	There is ample parking and the employees are pleasant, too.
17329	neg	I was about to write a poor review about Nordstrom's because for the 2nd time in 6 weeks we bought something from Nordstrom's and they left a security tag on an item and we didn't realize until we were home.
17330	pos	Went up front to checkout and low n behold my faith in Humanity was restored.

Pork Soup Dumplings ($9)
Pork and Vegetable Potstickers ($8)
Vegetable Dumplings ($9)
Shrimp, Pork and Vegetable Wontons - Szechuan Style ($6)
Taiwanese Style Sesame Cold Noodles - ($6)
Side of steamed rice - ($2)

I thought the veggie dumplings were just meh."
17332	neg	"However, I would recommend anyone who wants to try a little bit of the Brazilian tastes without spending a lot - if you don't eat that much and you go to a ""churrascaria"" (steakhouse) they will charge you a price that will mostly not pay off."
17333	neg	The food was not as good as Vegas - not the same ownership.
17334	neg	The mozzarella sticks were just ok for me.
17335	neg	The kind of moron you want to eat hoe cakes with.
17336	pos	After being promptly seated at one of the few booths in the cavernous restaurant as requested in our reservation, with a distant but still good view of the Bellagio Fountains, and immediately receiving black cloth napkins substituted out for the white ones on the table to cover our black pants, we decided to begin with a Shrimp Cocktail app.
17337	pos	Having the reserved seats meant when I purchased my seats online at 3 pm that I was able to pick from just about any seat in the theatre.
17338	pos	Most of the ones I've visited always push their preowned stuff on you and try to get your preorder a game, but this one didn't.
17339	pos	My wife can't even tell where the damage was.
17340	neg	In fact, there was so much spinning throughout the night that I felt like vomiting lol.
17341	neg	The restaurant is tiny (when paying the bill we noticed the kitchen was a dorm-sized one-woman operation!)
17342	pos	They are normally really busy but you can get thru the line fast and food comes out really fast as well.
17343	pos	Through the Home Warranty Company, a technician was dispatched in a very timely manner.
17344	pos	Also go Hopi hawks!!!!
17345	neg	WHAT A HOLE IN THE WALL!!
17346	pos	The puzzles were very easy and if you couldn't solve a puzzle, it was easy enough to through some guesses and get the correct answer to move onto the next puzzle.
17347	neg	Faced with thousands of screaming kids and lineups for crappy hotdogs and buckets of grease, I was about to just give in and join the closest cue for my slop.
17348	pos	I ate every last bite, and would order the same thing 10x over.
17349	neg	We should have made the drive to Scottsdale to go to Butters!
17350	pos	We never have any leftovers.
17351	pos	The donuts doesn't last in my home!
17352	pos	Every time the food & service has been simply FLAWLESS!!
17353	pos	I know with the pricing it will not be my last.
17354	neg	But the bartender is flirting with my boyfriend to make it right...
17355	neg	"It was in storage for the winter, and when I went to warm it up it showed ""key not recognized""- this presented all sorts of problems."
17356	pos	I recently stayed at the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas for the 2014 New Year celebration.
17357	pos	I have gone to a couple of Shoeless Joe's before and they have always been great, good food and good service.
17358	neg	Wish they had fountain soda I stead of cans.
17359	neg	On the other hand, the wellness booster tea had a little too much flavour, so unless you like it strong, don't leave your teabag in too long.
17360	pos	If you are decided to purchase a car/suv check out Dave in sales in Arrowhead, Good guy.
17361	pos	There was no pressure.
17362	neg	My husband is not a fan of ordering at a counter (too much pressure while others wait for you to review the menu).
17363	neg	They finally brought it out.
17364	pos	I was here for my nieces birthday party on busy Sunday night and for a party of 8 we only waited 15 mins.
17365	neg	if I had one thing that I would change it would be to maybe rearrange tables looked more like a night club than a restaurant.
17366	neg	The outside of the building is, as others have said, modest and not much to look at.
17367	neg	I found the chips distracting from the main star of the dish.
17368	pos	Our waitress was efficient and timely.
17369	pos	I'm all set with eating here again.
17370	pos	We have been four days in a row!
17371	pos	It judging by what happened from my last visit I owe them a great review.
17372	neg	So its not an awful cut just personal preference of not liking shorter cut (Note: it still about shoulder length.
17373	neg	The portion was small for the price.
17374	neg	I will echo other reviewers that the staff is not service focused, but I found them to be helpful once I got someone's attention.
17375	neg	Don't be a puss.
17376	neg	Can't have chips that get soggy and don't hold up to all these toppings.
17377	neg	And if you know the Vegas strip, it would've taken us another lifetime with all the car traffic and her efficiency to get to our hotel.
17378	neg	I didn't care for it.
17379	neg	I wasn't impressed to hear that the food was designed for people to share, especially given the prices.
17380	pos	At least this time they were on time and got it to the right address.
17381	neg	I had no room for dessert, and nothing looked too appetizing to me.
17382	neg	Can get super crowded especially on weekends.
17383	pos	Muah!
17384	pos	Now I've had the luck of never having my hair done poorly.
17385	neg	Needless to say I was not only extremely annoyed at this point but I was frustrated and mentally exhausted dealing with this entire situation.
17386	neg	He came back and reached across the entire table to grab the book from in front of me while we were still sitting there!!!
17387	pos	The atmosphere is nice and the servers are ok.
17388	neg	The place itself is very small with enough seating for about 30-40 people and that's pushing it.
17389	neg	Truthfully, anyone who lounges around and not eating quickly and go home should get bad service so the next person can have seating to enjoy.
17390	neg	I think they should offer the guests water.
17391	neg	Maybe they were having problems at first with timing.
17392	pos	Yeeeahhhhhh, baby.
17393	pos	Don't tell anyone else about this place.....the tourists will spoil it.
17394	neg	Unfortunately I don't have time travel abilities and am stuck with a paltry 8 check-ins here and non-elite status for '16 which I wear with Scarlet Letter-like shame.
17395	neg	The first bite of my tuna roll was not outstanding.
17396	pos	Gee, thanks for taking the time to talk to me and make it right, and this is the MANAGER!
17397	pos	5 stars for the food, -4 for the waiter.
17398	neg	I tried going to Gold Coast casino in Vegas off of flamingo and it's like pulling teeth to even try and win and usually there's a lot more people there so it's a lot harder.
17399	neg	I traded in my Mazda 3 that had some issues and I owed $5,000 more than it was worth (thanks to being screwed by the dealer that I bought it from).
17400	pos	I haven't met a friendlier staff.
17401	pos	Thanks a lot, Arizona Charlie's.
17402	pos	Person behind me gets a smile again.
17403	neg	I will say that the wasabi dressing when liberally applied could make your head feel like a candle that's just been lit so mix that with something.
17404	neg	It can get cramped/cozy/claustrophobic/small/youhavetogetthepointbynow.
17405	pos	Speaking of place, it is oddly situated by some rail road tracks in a row of mind numbing antique stores, which actually is perfect, nevermind.
17406	pos	There also a reason why they call it the baguette cafe.
17407	neg	Now, you have to understand that no baby will enjoy being checked for ties.
17408	pos	Tablecloths were clean, as was the dishes and silverware.
17409	pos	Talking to the manager she did an override on the room and allowed us to still have the second reserved room.
17410	pos	She apologized , got us a new server and convinced us to stay (we were about to leave ).
17411	pos	The best things about this place are the views, the pasta dishes, and Adam.
17412	neg	I've been unhappy for awhile but never change because it's a pain to start fresh but sometimes it's a blessing.
17413	neg	This man was convicted of his rascist handling of people of dark skin and I find it offensive that they wouldn't warn the public of this rally and also allow such a event at the same time as there Christmas in July event .
17414	neg	BTW, yes, I am frugal, and I bought the same part for less than half of his asking price at another establishment that day.
17415	pos	Also made sure we were okay with waiting 6 minutes for the 3 chicken sandwiches we ordered, which we were.
17416	pos	Although it was nice that we didn't have to wait for our table and it was a quiet night for the business, I am hoping they can gain more business in the near future.
17417	neg	My only grouse with the bar area is it was very dimly lit so that we needed the light of our mobile devices to read the menu.
17418	neg	It has to be about more than profits & the bottom line!
17419	neg	It shocks me that these are people who should be representing the Flamingo and all of Caesar's the most.
17420	neg	they either need to make ordering for efficient or have more cash registers.
17421	pos	If I checked in every time I came to eat here, I would look like a complete pizzaholic.
17422	pos	In the closest they had 2 soft bathrobes for me and my girlfriend.
17423	neg	The noon hour is a zoo with a line usually out the door.
17424	pos	I recently moved into the neighborhood and was pretty stoked that there were several food establishments on Coventry.

17426	pos	The sounds of the city are muted.
17427	pos	With purchasing a more effective antenna, and mounting it on the roof, we now have HD programming... FOR FREE.
17428	neg	Our salad came out quite quickly, but then it took forever for the pizza, so it was hard to maintain self-control over the salad while waiting.
17429	neg	Wish them luck with business practice like that.
17430	pos	First off I will agree, the staff are friendly.
17431	pos	When I had made my reservation, I had indicated that we were celebrating my Wife's birthday and I requested a private corner table.
17432	pos	It wasn't busy at all for a Saturday brunch hour.
17433	pos	When I went there, they had a lunch special promotion- a choice of sushi, fried rice, sashimi, etc for a price of CAD 5.99.
17434	pos	While living in Austria (Europe) for 10 years, I have always loved Gelato over American icecream (no offense meant.

17436	pos	These delicious treats didn't last long in our house.
17437	pos	If i remember right, went as far to make my child birthday a day to remember.
17438	pos	It was just all right.
17439	pos	Line does go by quickly as there are like 5 people serving you at one time.
17440	neg	I have seen Thai BBQ food & service quality go down the drain.
17441	pos	There are not that many choices in terms of Asian food in the West Valley so I can see why people come here.
17442	pos	The place is decorated well and was busy on a Friday night.
17443	pos	We go out to dinner probably 1x a month and this Was our favorite place.
17444	pos	Seriously just fall off the bone.
17445	pos	Their soup spoons have the hooks on the end to prevent them from sinking into your large bowl, i love these spoons!
17446	pos	Thank you for never doing so!
17447	pos	Having a bartender you actually 'want' to talk too doesn't sound like a big deal..but it is.
17448	pos	So we went across the street to Sweet nails and were in and out in an hour.
17449	pos	Ive been to other locations and they were nothing but delightful, lucky that this location happens to be the most convenient.
17450	pos	Explained to how it worked why it went bad and what could do to extend the life of it.
17451	neg	I couldn't stand on one leg, squat or traverse stairs without swelling, pain and fear of falling on my first appointment.
17452	neg	Normally this wouldn't be a big deal I understand things happen but I reminder her four times about it before I left and she was rude about it when I returned.
17453	neg	"As far as Moon Nursery goes, I would not recommend them based on my first experience with the first sales guy Robert ""Bob"",  he made me feel like I left a used car lot and got screwed over so to speak."
17454	neg	Historically I've always cringe at the thought of dealing with vacuum cleaner repair centers because they are always trying to sell you a new cleaner or end up charging more then what they originally quoted.
17455	pos	I was originally pleased to find a primary care office after moving to the area.
17456	neg	I have thought about reporting them to the Contractors Board and the BBB.
17457	pos	They're always having a deal with their month unlimited packages.
17458	neg	FU Dresslers!
17459	neg	I was a bit disappointed at first because I hate the first day when it is so extremely flat against my head if you know what I mean.
17460	pos	This will be me returning location.
17461	pos	YUUUM!
17462	pos	If you want truly delicious beer, go to Resident Culture.
17463	neg	We arrived about an hour before check-in and the lines were crazy long but nobody was using the express checking kiosks.
17464	neg	Didn't like that the least expensive glass of red wine was $31 though.
17465	pos	I've taken mine, and my bf's, cars here pretty much since we moved to Vegas last summer.
17466	pos	I was VERY pleased with the ladies restroom.
17467	neg	Parking was a bit of a trip, though.
17468	pos	But after Vann greeted us, he turned all that angst into a joke.
17469	neg	Needing a new rear tire, I contact these guys, since I'm sick and fucking tired of dealing with all the Harley Stealerships strewn all across our country, ripping off customers on labor and parts at every opportunity.
17470	pos	It's glory days were gone a long time ago but it was fun still.
17471	pos	I always get this for my son as it makes the most sense.

17475	neg	I don't need to be stuck with other boba tea joint's idea of how to put together bob teas.
17476	neg	There is only one waitress barely caring for all of the customers and she does not have time for your needs.
17477	neg	How can he complain when he is only in there to start drama!
17478	pos	And it seemed like they had as much servers/employees in the restaurant as customers dining... make sense bc you need a cheese chart person, bread cart person, a change the napkin person, someone to stand near the bathroom and point you to the right direction person, and two different hostess; one to greet, one to open the door for you.
17479	pos	They're low, but they're expectations!
17480	pos	The menu is enormous.
17481	pos	Thanks guys...
17482	neg	The sandwiches do get a little greasy, at least the Tony Soprano that I usually get--could just be the dressing on that one.
17483	neg	They have some great pizza however they do not serve water for free.
17484	pos	Great place for vegans!!
17485	pos	Next time my fiance says suit, I'm jumping on it.
17486	pos	There were only two pieces super tender calamari with a yummy vegetable sauce.

17494	pos	Everything came out one thing at a time.
17495	pos	If you rush through the store you'll miss a lot, so take your time!
17496	pos	The meat was very  heavy on the black pepper which I enjoy, but some might not.
17497	neg	It's a little claustrophobic in there, so try to get a table out of the way- or just get your stuff to go.
17498	neg	I've had much better elsewhere.
17499	neg	I ate here the morning after a horrible over priced meal that consisted of lobster and spaghetti.
17500	pos	So we took a cab and the ride was only 10 minutes and cost less for 3 people than our return price for showtime.
17501	neg	The previous owner also never painted the stucco so there was several spots that needed to be repaired first.
17502	pos	The guy that took my order was lovely, the delivery guy (possibly same guy) was very sweet.
17503	neg	Not my fav item.
17504	neg	10/10 we decided just to get a new unit as our renter was in 90+ degree place complaining as she should, so we called for price on that hoping again to get a break....no break, no call back even.
17505	pos	The Master:  Super greasy goodness in every bite!
17506	pos	The looks of the casino looks outdated and kinda sad, but the buffet located up stairs is updated and clean.

17508	pos	It is a very average price for CrossFit.
17509	pos	I've stayed at other extended stay americas before and I've always like staying here because of the kitchenette.
17510	pos	Go ahead and eat here!

20570	neg	I feel like that should be expected at a place like this considering who owns it, where it's located and how much it costs per plate.
20571	pos	So the owner took advantage of their 30-day warranty.
20572	neg	I was a little worried about the quantity of food since we had 12 very hungry guys in attendance.

20598	neg	The Lentil soup was average--I added some tabbouleh to liven it up.
20599	pos	We can pig out here for $30 and when we order an equivalent meal at a different sushi place end up spending $60.

20617	pos	Left satisfied.

20635	pos	I can only think of one other place where I would rather get chicken fingers in Toronto.
20636	neg	That was hardly the meat from an entire duck??
20637	neg	Especially since the dim sum offerings in Pittsburgh leave quite a bit to be desired.
20638	pos	Came here for my birthday because we saw this place on one of those food shows, and I really wanted some good Italian food.
20639	neg	There was a line going outside the building for the main check in.

20641	pos	This was always one of the best dunkin donuts in town.
20642	pos	I have eaten this pizza all the time in Chicago and love it.

20665	pos	Just great.
20666	pos	After being greeted by a server who turned out to be FANTASTIC I settled on the chicken chilaquiles.
20667	neg	My poor boyfriend.
20668	neg	What I didn't know is that they only validate $1.50; and the total was $3, so we had to pay $1.50 for it, which isn't bad, but I was little taken a back since I thought it'd be free.
20669	neg	When the meals came, there was no sauce on my pasta.
20670	neg	Only downside is the place is a bit small for the demand.
20671	neg	I think it was official overdose.

20676	neg	- kim chee fried rice: I normally love kim chee fried rice, but I it was a little heavy on onion for my taste.
20677	neg	They will all back each other up doesn't matter if you follow the chain of command.
20678	neg	Just not so great at paying attention to detail.

20681	pos	We went for lunch on a Tuesday and it was busy but we only waited for about 10 minutes for a table.
20682	pos	We have been Mercedes owners for a long time and every dealership across the country has always without exception honored the complimentary car wash and checkup.
20683	neg	A tad pricey, but hey, load it up with toppings and foul get what you pay for!
20684	neg	I never like the reason for going which is usually to fix something that is broken.
20685	neg	We wanted a booth and only tables were available.
20686	neg	So Corrine called Joe over to ask for help with the coupon issue and they had to void all the items and start all over again to figure out what coupon wouldn't take..
20687	neg	Ugh...
20688	pos	That was freaky at first but once we were up in the plane it was like a big window.
20689	pos	That being said, my home is only 5 minutes away.
20690	pos	Our waiter was helpful and attentive, but not intrusive.
20691	pos	We were thinking of trying the Degustation Menu, but from past experiences, I knew I couldn't possibly eat 16 courses and come out feeling good no matter how delicious the food is.
20692	pos	"Pos

The fried rice was fine."
20693	pos	However the salesman was amazing, patient, helpful and very remorseful but a company is only as good as its leaders!
20694	neg	They are expensiveish.... bc you are on the stip.
20695	pos	I'll be back for the fries and the fries alone.
20696	neg	So our property manager calls one day and says they found bedbugs.
20697	neg	My boyfriend had called ahead for a reservation,  but unfortunately, they only take reservations on weekends for parties of 6 or more.
20698	pos	Today, I wasn't hungry enough for a full meal, but the best fries in Charlotte sounded about right, so I went to Fran's to give them a try.
20699	pos	Let me start off by saying that I really liked the Nurse Practitioner who saw us, Rita.
20700	pos	The spinach was fine as a green but the gnocchi, with chunks of crab, was a nice accompaniment to the fish as its creaminess was a nice dipping alternative to change the flavor palette of the meal.
20701	pos	I book a car with them just because it was the cheapest I can find online, $33.
20702	pos	I called College Hunks and the price was low and the customer service was great (I should have known something was up they were the only company with openings).
20703	neg	I didn't really had good experiences with the installers.
20704	neg	Our experience in the recent past is that it is very difficult to find professionals that treat you with caring, kindness, and respect and that are not trying to maximize revenue at your expense (AKA rip you off).
20705	neg	In the only downside of our evening, as the restaurant got busier around 9pm, the speed of the service suffered.
20706	pos	Then you have a whole WEEK to play it and if it sucks then you can return it for a full refund!
20707	pos	This place was bomb.
20708	pos	Their website claimed they had several of that specific model in stock and that they had the lowest prices, I was instantly excited.
20709	pos	I spent 48.00 on a filet mignon and if it were 75.00 i probably would pay that price to for it.
20710	pos	This place was empty @ 5:30 and, based on the food, it should be full.
20711	neg	They offered free beer and wine, but they only had Coors and some weird red sangria so no thanks.
20712	pos	Now comes he exciting part.
20713	neg	So many places say they can make items vegan, and then end up tasting fishy or bland.
20714	neg	So far I could be happier with the service provided.
20715	neg	The dr was very sarcastic with a serious situation to me.
20716	neg	"Folks, don't be fooled by the typical ""halo effect"" that tends to permeate Yelp (i.e."
20717	pos	Like many people who have posted on here, Firefly offers big food for low price.
20718	pos	I think it may be better than dinner.
20719	pos	Was I Upset, Nope!
20720	pos	When I walked in I wasn't planning on having my mind blown, I haven't really heard rave reviews but me and my significant other thought we would give it a try.
20721	pos	Getting a full face of makeup will cost you a $50 dollar product purchase, but that's not bad... considering you leave with $50 bucks of product and a pretty pout!
20722	pos	Food was grubalicious.
20723	pos	The waiter went as far as cleaning off the table every single time he took a plate or brought a plate.
20724	neg	You can see it in my picture...Servers should pay attention to detail when they're running food out to tables...
20725	neg	I had the Coke, bad idea.
20726	pos	We were offered water while we waited for take out.
20727	pos	Well the girl's got an awesome room instead.
20728	pos	Besides that, it's a good gym.
20729	neg	Started having scorpion problems that were quite stubborn.
20730	pos	You mean I don't have to drive downtown and pay for parking to eat Bao??
20731	neg	Making the appearance seem unappetizing.
20732	neg	I will be the first to admit that I have some horrible feet.
20733	pos	I was there today and I knew exactly what I wanted to buy.
20734	pos	So you definitely are going to miss this employee she was exceptional at her job.
20735	neg	Recently my daughter and I bought two nearly tasteless and dry McDonald's meals for approx.
20736	neg	That mechanic didn't check anything else.
20737	pos	I will use this company again and refer them from my own business.
20738	pos	They change the menu twice a day so you know the fish is beyond fresh and when they run out, that's it.
20739	pos	The first one was delicious as usual.
20740	pos	Not even the best part, well maybe it was the best part, was halfway through the morning: my 14 year old pulled in a 29+ pound salmon.
20741	neg	The hummus finally came.
20742	pos	The bread and fries were good.
20743	neg	So sometimes it takes a long time to be seen.
20744	pos	Too many great Asian choices in East Valley.
20745	pos	I come here way more than I need to.
20746	pos	Despite his lack of liveliness, he was very friendly when taking my order.
20747	pos	If you're looking for a fancy restaurant this is not the place, if your looking for good food look no further.
20748	neg	There's a lot to take in on your first trip and the line gets long pretty quickly during lunch hour.
20749	pos	They were able to see him the next day!
20750	pos	Congratulations to Me !!!
20751	pos	I was hooked up with an awesome room at the new Aria hotel and was psyched to start my evening with a gym workout, sauna, shower, and head down the strip with a beer in hand.
20752	neg	I can see it being cramped if more than 30 people are there at the same time.
20753	pos	She agreed that could be done.
20754	pos	I always come when in town, this time i came with my sisters who have never been  to vegas.
20755	pos	So I called Stanley Steamer who came out the same day and made my carpets look brand new.
20756	neg	I trusted my gut and went back to Beaumont and sure enough, most of that work wasn't necessary.
20757	neg	Regardless, they need to get those elevators going because that's what everyone will remember... people were livid.
20758	neg	She recovered quickly but was not going near the bread again (there was also cornbread and a sweeter bread with raisins).
20759	neg	All the students I saw seems professional and eager to learn except one.
20760	neg	The company's organization seems pretty poor.
20761	pos	They had to cancel our appointment but gave us a free service to make up for it.
20762	neg	For some reason, my review disappeared from yelp along with a lot of other positive reviews.
20763	pos	She was friendly and chatted the whole time.
20764	pos	We also ordered the veggie pizza which I was lucky to get a slice of since the table devoured (with good reason) before I had my chance to attack.
20765	neg	I should also note that I had visited Birks in Chinook last night as well - I was not even greeted while I browsed the store.
20766	pos	One less thing to worry about.
20767	neg	Second, they don't have a list of referred installers, they have a 800 number to some database, that refers you to who knows who..and that was smart on their part, they don't have to have any responsibility for the installation.
20768	pos	Had planned to eat dinner at the bar and then discovered that a table opened up due to a last minute reservation cancellation.
20769	pos	I ended up getting the Lemonberry cupcake since I had been craving lemon things all day since it was so hot!
20770	pos	The room was quite nice for what I expected to  find and sitting in front of the strip.
20771	neg	You actually have to walk through a pawn shop to get to the entrance.
20772	pos	Or maybe it really is kept that nice.
20773	pos	Thank you BOA for putting a Jamba Juice in your building.
20774	neg	Essentially I was either not impressed with the selection or I was given the hard sell on a bike without anyone spending time to actually fit me and understand what I was trying to get to.
20775	neg	This oddly enough was my least favorite part and this is odd because I am actually rather fond of mushrooms.
20776	neg	Being unable to see at the computer where I make my living was really sucking.
20777	neg	It looked like someone had a party in the 3 rooms.
20778	pos	"Update: 

I appreciate the reply."
20779	neg	READ ALL NEGATIVE REVIEWS!
20780	neg	I had a list of irritations.
20781	pos	The place is huge with three separate rooms, but they seat everyone in one place.
20782	pos	He apologized for it and was generous enough to take care of it.
20783	neg	Received a car smelly and wipe for the inside of my car unexpectantly .
20784	pos	Almost identical menu and MUCH better service and atmosphere.
20785	pos	Please don't tell everyone about this place because it's our little secret.
20786	pos	The decor manages to both expand on the slow rebranding that's been taking place at the Saint-Bruno location and find its own distinct voice.
20787	pos	The service rep talked to the owner and they replaced it for free.
20788	pos	If you are a fan of something spicy, request for their secret housemade ghost pepper sauce, this thing would literally burn your mouth!
20789	pos	Pool service was great tho.
20790	pos	I left this place with a bunch of food.
20791	pos	The gruop wasn't in a rush, and the waitress didn't rush us.
20792	pos	All I know is that I certainly feel like I could possibly be getting blue balls from my lack of eating at Sensotei.
20793	pos	Sometimes at Fogo I felt rushed and pushed..not here.
20794	pos	When we first arrived we were checked in by a friendly staff member and we told her it was our first time visiting.
20795	neg	I had an order take about 20 minutes which is pushing it.
20796	pos	All this, FOR FREE.
20797	neg	So loud our server couldn't even hear us when ordering.
20798	pos	"The toilet or ""bidet"" as I guess its called was like a robot and had a heated toilet seat and a massager!!!"
20799	neg	I'm not a fan of any desserts they offer.
20800	pos	If you're going to go to bartending school, just remember two things.
20801	neg	I'd be ok w it being 4 or 5 bucks, it's 6.
20802	neg	I found it to be flavourful, but lacking a lightly sweet sauce to complement the saltiness that I'm used to.
20803	pos	Other notes:  Rice is not included in the meal but THEY DO NOT CHARGE FOR IT.
20804	pos	Flavorful!
20805	pos	The sugar had actually caramelized, coating the entire cookie in a slightly burnt caramel goodness.
20806	neg	They have since been out numerous times even showing them a recording of what's happening.
20807	pos	You only pay for the kids... adults are free.
20808	neg	I was a little surprised they were giving me 4 hours' notice to change an appointment, but in the end they honoured my original time, but not without turning off all the lights by the time I got there (early) and making me feel like I was keeping them from going home.
20809	pos	Outrageous Olive Oils and Vinegars I am convinced was created just for me and my love of all things olive oil.
20810	neg	But I say I don't feel the air, he says its working fine and that's the best he can do.
20811	pos	Thankfully when we went to get our dog at the end of the day the lady at the front desk was nice as well.
20812	neg	Sorry, NY bagel, you do not even compare.
20813	neg	Very disappointed with the new menu!
20814	pos	Luke wasn't sure if he could get it ready by next day and said he would try.
20815	pos	Attention is paid to the food, and you are not paying for the ambience.
20816	pos	Not free snacks....but FREE SNACKS.
20817	neg	I've also tried the cookies but they were super hard, asking if the cookies are fresh might make sense.
20818	pos	Then without even attempting to offer me a warranty plan or any type of upsell (I'm a female, it's a men's watch, perfect opportunity to see if I could use a warranty plan for this obvious gift), she wrapped it (as offered by her and accepted by me), put it in a bag, slapped in on the counter and sent me on my way.
20819	neg	BTW - cash only here, no plastic.
20820	neg	Taps are rotating all the time so its hard to keep up!
20821	pos	I told her it was my birthday so I was gonna order a mimosa with my coffee.
20822	neg	Definitely don't come if you are in a rush.
20823	pos	"We realized that there was a ""normal"" server as she came up to the table a bit later."
20824	pos	He was very professional and said he'd be happy to make it up to us and asked for my address to send us something in the mail.
20825	pos	The spaghetti was good but nothing compared to the other dish.
20826	pos	And I tried them more than twice!
20827	pos	He said that he would request the right couch for us, & send a note to customer service to call us at 10am the next morning when the store opened.
20828	pos	It's not salty at all.
20829	neg	I was so frustrated that I just dealt with it until I was transferred back to Pittsburgh and couldn't take it anymore.
20830	pos	Four extra miles but Great food and never have had a mishap with them.
20831	neg	For some reason I'm never in the mood for them.
20832	neg	Went to buy pizza by the slice at about 11pm the other night and it was quite busy.. so much that they couldn't keep any pizza out.
20833	neg	priced a little high.
20834	neg	Of course they want to prescribe steroids and other toxic medication that makes you have no immune system.
20835	neg	If they went the extra step to improve this community it would better themselves.
20836	pos	The wait was experienced and coursed out our food for us.
20837	neg	Wtf, for real.
20838	pos	I made sure that the woman was aware of my current credit situation (around 500 score, very bad I know) and she assured me this would not hinder my application process..
20839	pos	It looks super fancy; however, at least with the early evening crew the dress code wasnt out of control.
20840	neg	They are charging delivery.
20841	pos	"GREAT FOOD
Great view

22247	pos	Had my experience been less I would've only gotten my card renewal, so Major props 2 the guy manning the store (not sure if he was a manager or not) but was on~the~ball like a Gr8 1!!
22248	pos	Long story short, I don't think I will order a Reuben anywhere else...

22274	pos	I can use the bowl option and the free tortilla chips to DIY some nachos, but it's not the same because you won't have the gooey mess of cheese like normal nachos.
22275	pos	I also decided to keep a few of the boxes because I needed to put some items in storage -- no problem there either, they just charged me $.50 per box to keep them and charged my credit card.

22278	pos	Determined to have a good birthday I press forward.

22281	pos	The food was nice and cold.
22282	pos	The Fresh Spring Rolls was our appetizer, lots of lettace and only a little Tofu but the Peanut Sauce was much better than Pho Kim Long.

22291	pos	Not what you would expect in a food court.
22292	neg	I would love to give the food 4-5 stars as I have never been disappointed by it, but this review is for the service on this occasion.
22293	neg	They need to update the speaker system so the vocals can be understood.
22294	neg	The bartenders from a skill point of view are laughable, but they will lean over the bar and laugh and talk loudly about themselves.

22297	pos	Restaurant itself is amazing.

22303	pos	Two words .....bad ass.
22304	neg	If you are on a budget you will find it stressful.

22312	pos	It is convenient and the brick walls give off an urban feel.
22313	pos	Aside from having such a great quantity of meat, the meat was so moist it tasted as if it had actually been in the chile for some time when we all know it hadn't been since they make the bowl to order.
22314	pos	Not like some places where someone drops something and they leave it for someone else to pick up or just don't even care.
22315	neg	Visited AB for the fifth and final time tonight.
22316	neg	Parking was a bit of a problem so Valet if not park on the 3rd floor.
22317	pos	"(Wow, talk about food porn...)

- Coleslaw: I'm usually not a coleslaw person, but it looked to be the fan favorite based on my incredibly obvious lascivious stares at the trays of diners eating inside."
22318	neg	One downside is that they often only have their specialty movies (like foreign films or Studio Ghibli movies for example) offered during lunch time when the ticket prices are higher so you always end up paying more for them.
22319	pos	Most impressive was how the two ladies with the dog were leaning in close over the counter where food is served.
22320	neg	Note:  I hate how they blowdried my hair.
22321	pos	Delivery was fast.
22322	neg	I've done my best to fill them in, but they never looked right, plus it was a total hassle.
22323	neg	Only criticism was for a short while the line was long to place your order and it intruded on the space of some diners who already were eating in the dining area.
22324	neg	Gnats flying around all of us all the time we ate.
22325	pos	JR was still not done with us and decided to bring out another cart...yes the dessert cart with small bite sized eclairs, lollipops, macaroons, tartlets, chocolates,...we were almost in a food concussion from the combinations thrown at us by the gifted folks at JR.

22356	pos	I was satisfied.
22357	pos	the guy said fine, that can be done.

22367	pos	No perfume, texting while hogging a machine or creepy guys who follow you around the gym as you do dead lifts (ladies you know what I'm talking about).
22368	pos	I almost felt like fighting Jason for the last bite.
22369	neg	We saw other tables getting their food and drinks right away.
22370	pos	5) As it was a friends birthday and we didn't have dessert (normally it's comped if you tell your server), the waiter comped one of our appetizers instead.
22371	neg	So I'll just chalk that one up to a fluky seasonal hire and move on.
22372	neg	Ohhh and don't take photos or else the DJ will call you out and boot you out of the mansion.

22384	pos	My fiancé and I fell in love with this place with all the pictures posted and great deals they have!
22385	neg	The service was kind of a disappointment last time - they had just hosted a private party and were frantically trying to clear the guests out so we waited a while to be served, they kept bringing bad mixers (flat Sprite), and they ran out of pineapple and grapefruit juice - but the manager on duty sent over a free round of Red Bulls for all of us which would have cost around $100 if we had to pay for them, so I thought that was very cool of him.
22386	pos	My gel manicure lasted 3 weeks!
22387	neg	And I don't even like crab.
22388	pos	We ate like kings.
22389	pos	Their menu has a wide selection and it definitely bums me out that I couldn't go a second time before I left.

23587	pos	We really were interested in the GTI, but James rightly suggested we look at the TDI because of the fuel mileage even though they are priced several thousand less than a GTI and this would, I imagine, have reduced his commission.
23588	neg	Cool, wish I had known that before I was naked.

24448	pos	Thus  only going to the best pet store.
24449	neg	I'm a big eater and I really want to get my money's worth, so the reason why goong ruined it for me was the lack of portion and overhyped quality.

24500	pos	What this place has going on is the hip atmosphere to attract people.
24501	neg	First I've been here before to get my iPhone 6s repaired with minimal problems, there's a little bright misshapen circle in the top left corner but it's something I didn't notice until months later, plus it doesn't affect the functions of the phone itself so no big deal.
24502	pos	I work and live in uptown Charlotte and network with everyone I come across, even tourist that ask where they should go while they are in town- I used to send them here.

24542	neg	And the bagger was still clueless.
24543	pos	And, again, the decaf was very good.
24544	neg	However it was obvious no one had primary ownership of my table so if there is a hiccup in the service no one sees it.
24545	neg	We had to wait about half an hour for our food, even though we ordered before the other people coming in.

25420	pos	And guess what there is no 20 min wait anymore.

25427	pos	Last night my wife, best friend and myself were out trying to get some some dinner for my wife's bday.
25428	neg	I know mistakes can be made but people ask for specifics for a reason, and I feel like the extra money I pay for this healthy food should go towards at least getting my order correct.
25429	neg	Uneven pacing between courses, awkward periods when service people would congregate near our table and chit-chat.
25430	pos	It was a special occasion.

25443	pos	Lucky for me, thats not what I'm there for!
25444	pos	Food was GREAT but our waitress was a different story.
25445	pos	-Prices are within reason but not cheap - similar to what you might expect to pay for decent, ethnic food in Madison, but more than an urban / metropolitan area that has an Chinese community.
25446	pos	I have 3 boys and one of my biggest pet peeves is when the waitress/waiter brings me or other adults at the table food before the kids because by the time they get theirs they have already eaten half of mine...

25449	pos	Get their gift card- your water refill will be INSANELY cheap!

25459	pos	I look and yep also out of teriyaki chicken so i went next door and had sushi AGAIN

25476	pos	After I took my first bite, I cried a little bit knowing that I probably won't share the 3 other cupcakes with my family anymore.
25477	neg	I knew I could not afford invasive surgery for a tummy tuck or other similar procedures to get rid of the rolls on my belly!

25489	neg	I recommend choosing your sandwich before heading in since they're pretty packed, and deciding on a sandwich from the menu on their wall can be overwhelming (there's a few hundred sandwiches to choose from).
25490	pos	The macarons are made by someone from Paris!
25491	neg	Hopefully things have gotten better since then.
25492	pos	well they got it done on time and I drove away.
25493	neg	The welcome we received walking in was colder than darth vader in outer space.
25494	neg	At $150 an hour, I was cringing a little at the outset.
25495	neg	The rice was a bit mushy.
25496	pos	Grab your utensils before you sit down, and a staff would usually offer house chips and salsa before the meal.

25498	neg	THIEVES!
25499	pos	They agreed and thanked me for it.
25500	neg	One thing I will say is that we came casually dressed and it seemed as if the waiter didn't treat us as well as he treated the people who came in suits and all.

25538	neg	There we stood in an inch of water, totally shell-shocked, half laughing, but still seriously worried about our phones, when the tub turned itself back on a THIRD time - thankfully the water was all drained out or distributed into the room at this point, so no further soaking occurred, but now the pump wouldn't turn off.

25547	neg	(They hate that word.
25548	neg	I see the reviews and that's all well and good, but every time I go into Sonora, it's empty!
25549	neg	With that being said, we went to a Salon, the girl there looked at both of us and said she was booked up for the day :( Went to Ulta and the hair dresser there said the person who cuts our type of hair is not in...my daughter got the feeling that no one wanted to cut her hair.

25576	pos	We ate at the bar because we find always better service.

25637	pos	The woman that I spoke to was sweet and assured us that it'd be ok.
25638	pos	Keep in mind though that most importantly is they don't have Roy at their stores, someone who knows what he's talking about and cares that you leave the store happy and with something your going to enjoy by yourself or with others.

25640	pos	BIG TIME SCAMMERS!

25653	neg	It must have been the owner that noticed, but I probably had a look of discontent on my face.
25654	pos	The staff was wonderful.
25655	neg	What would have made the experience so much better was a little cultural education (clearly we had never eaten Eritrean cuisine before).
25656	pos	The portion wasn't skimpy either - at some restaurants when you order jumbo ravioli you get 3-4 pieces, but this was more than double the size.
25657	pos	We wanted easy no mess finger foods - there was spicy chicken salad in a wanton cone, tuna/chicken salad/cucumber finger sandwiches, frittata, salad and a couple hors d'oeuvres that I never got around to trying (I think a vegetarian and a meat one).

25663	neg	I imagine it can get very busy (good for them, not so good if you dislike lines/waiting).
25664	pos	My puppy, Hodoo, is always falling asleep on his way back home and sleeps through the night, which means that he was really playing all day with staffs and other puppies!
25665	pos	I DO NOT let anyone touch my hair except my mom.
25666	pos	I took a picture of it believing that it will be tasty, because it looks delicious.
25667	neg	I hate having to add sweetener to teas because it always changes the taste and I really just like my tea to be a tad sweet anyway.
25668	pos	The complex in general was quiet.
25669	pos	The cost $58, so okay not a problem.
25670	neg	My husband finally went over to the coffee station, brought the pot  to our table and filled our empty cups.
25671	pos	I've yet to find something I didn't really care for.
25672	neg	This is the only negative and its getting to tight in there to dance now.

25680	pos	I was given a whole bowl when I asked for another lime wedge because mine was dried out.
25681	pos	I love mom and pop business but this one really takes the cake ..
25682	neg	If you are looking for the latest fashion this is probably not the place for you.
25683	pos	He was honest when he said motor is bad but fan is good.
25684	pos	Having had wonderful meals all week, I expected nothing less that exceptional service at Mastro's Ocean Club.
25685	pos	"As far as price, take a look at any of the ""name brand"" hotels and it's not that expensive."
25686	neg	Due to the color of our skin .
25687	pos	Their service left me in awe.
25688	pos	My feet thanked me.

25694	pos	Come on a date if you are looking to impress.

25705	pos	She's very open and loving.
25706	pos	Not busy at all on a Tuesday at 3pm, I don't know about other days.
25707	pos	And now I can use the money I saved on gorgeous flowers, and a better photographer and DJ!
25708	neg	She wasn't very friendly and I grabbed my own crayons for my kid.
25709	neg	Granted, it's not hard to mess up a black eye, but still.
25710	neg	He is located in the Huntington building basement (on the corner of East 9th and Euclid), which is hard to find.
25711	neg	No mini-fridge.
25712	pos	They took great pains to cover things in plastic to ensure they stayed clean.

25715	pos	It's by far in my opinion the best of all the Fast Food joints.
25716	pos	The best part of my meal was the dessert tray that came out.

25718	pos	By the way, this was our 3rd time there, and it was only my first experience that was great.
25719	neg	Not impressed.
25720	neg	"My friend was putting a lot of the special sauce on his fried rice that was meant for the soup and the manager came over to stop him and said ""this sauce is very expensive don't use too much"" in her thick Viet accent."
25721	pos	One of my favorite things on this planet.
25722	neg	After driving my truck for a day, I could tell the problem was not fixed and even felt worse.
25723	pos	The haircut joint in Vista is awesome, the girls are hot, and they're really fun.
25724	pos	It wasnt like every other low grade carry out place like I was expecting with tough chicken and overly salty sauces.
25725	pos	I am someone who trusts no one when it comes to my eyebrows, but given the great reviews this place received on Yelp, I figured I would give these gals a shot.
25726	pos	B-dubs and WingStop can't hold up against their wings.
25727	pos	They were better than what I had orginally ordered but tasted similar to what I could make at home.

25750	pos	The happy hour prices are what brought us in.
25751	pos	4-The food literally came out in 10 minutes.
25752	neg	The crazy thing is both times I could hear them greet the person in front of me and behind me so why ignore me when I pull up?
25753	neg	We asked where we could park since the self park was also full and she told us to figure it out!
25754	neg	I guess, but they chose to do nothing, so I guess not!

25758	pos	Definitely one of her top 3 poutines shes had so far to date.
25759	pos	The atmosphere is very traditional like, noisy and crowded, feels like you are in Hong Kong or Guangdong,  a good place for homesick people in the desert.

25761	pos	I don't understand why the ratings are so low and why are there so many complaints!
25762	pos	All in all, I had such high hopes for the place and they were super nice.
25763	pos	I was happy there were healthier options to choose from the menu.
25764	pos	I only hope that the owner passes her recipe on to her children and that they're willing to put in the hard work and attention that she does.

25766	pos	So we got to the hotel and the bellman/valets greeted us in usual fashion.

26903	neg	Get ready to parallel park, which I am horrible at.
26904	pos	Newks ( a sandwich chain) has incredible lobster bisque and they are a deli!
26905	pos	It was the perfect combination of roasted malt and hoppy bitterness.
26906	neg	Whatever the reason, shame people, shame.
26907	neg	Any party more than 4 would take a lot longer I assume, as the place is very tiny.
26908	pos	The waitress was accommodating, especially when she brought the wrong dish for my friend and had a new plate quickly made.
26909	neg	Mesa Grill was disappointing; BARMASA was a disaster.
26910	pos	Catching one to get somewhere is easy.
26911	pos	None of my family would have guessed it was vegan (except for the part where I ate it, which kinda gives it way).
26912	pos	Keep up the GREAT WORK!
26913	pos	First, go in the gift shop, and let nostalgia fill your giddiness with giddiness.
26914	pos	Also a Wildflower bread is on its way, and I think it will do well.
26915	pos	*You forget your at a McDonald's of how it's set up.
26916	pos	Oh, and her prices are beyond reasonable.
26917	neg	They have an app so you order ahead but I've had bad experiences with that.
26918	neg	Arcade closed.
26919	neg	I guess my meal just wasn't very filling.
26920	neg	With others I feel they want to rush through it and finish so that they can go home.
26921	pos	When you come into a steakhouse and order a ribeye, you naturally juice up your mouth believing that soon you will be enjoying the juicy medium rare steak seasoned to perfection and to your taste.
26922	pos	Super nice inside good music mix of hip-hop and house dj was putting it down !
26923	pos	night is ok
26924	neg	They may want to invest in more bartenders on the weekend though.
26925	neg	I was so sick and didn't realize I had 102 temp and pneumonia plus on top of that I was dehydrated.
26926	pos	So the hostess went to ask her manager if was possible to prepare the meal just for us.
26927	pos	But I'm glad that a year after that I happen to come in for a business emergency and found out that she no longer works there...
26928	pos	And the chocolate shake was DELICIOUS.
26929	pos	Everything is sweet from the potato salad to the beans.

26942	neg	Wish they would sell the Stetson Chopped and ship it to me in San Diego...
26943	pos	The first time was amazing, very attentive staff.

26949	pos	All three burgers where good.
26950	neg	The mini beef bowl has minimal amount of beef.
26951	pos	Given the convenience of the location and the consistently awesome selection of beers at Caliente, I would assume this would be one of our regular spots.
26952	pos	The only bad part about the sandwich is that after eating it I wanted to just curl up into a ball and take a nap.
26953	neg	The only con is that not all servers speak English and service can be a little slow.
26954	pos	I messaged the Facebook page and got an immediate response stating they will look into the TV issue.
26955	pos	We had to take a few months off of lifting due to an injury so this was a great arrangement.
26956	pos	The room was quiet and private, and they gave each person a free movie pass!
26957	neg	I usually won't try a unreviewed place as food is usually poor quailty in Phx.
26958	neg	Don't even bother trying the other desserts here cause you're going to hate yourself like I did the 2 or 3 times I strayed.
26959	pos	We quickly ditched our plans to go barhopping to enjoy more time at Dublin O'Neil's.
26960	pos	She gave me a piece of flat bread that I saw the cook baking fresh in a clay oven and told me to help myself to the soup and salad bar.
26961	pos	All the appetizers we ordered were, I thought, a very good value proposition, even if they were nothing to write home about.
26962	pos	Once I move out here in a few weeks, its going to take some major willpower to keep me away from this place.
26963	pos	Pretty incredible.
26964	pos	For years my husband and I have frequently visited the wild wing cafe in Knoxville.
26965	neg	I wasn't sure what exactly they had to count (it couldn't take long!).
26966	pos	If your in need of any permanent makeup this is the place!
26967	neg	I didn't like the timeshare thing, but that's not really part of the hotel, so I won't hold it against them.
26968	pos	Though there was a bit of a line and not much seating, once we got our food to the office there wasn't much of a conversation with everyone enjoying their meals.
26969	neg	Either buy a bigger glass or STOP charging nearly $5 for a small glass of juice.
26970	pos	The dining room was clean and modern with lots of seating.
26971	neg	They both got the Sh!ts.
26972	pos	The other plate that was ordered was the 4 deuces...2 eggs, 2 pancakes, 2 sausage links and 2 strips of bacon.
26973	pos	De-li-cious tacos for $9 straight.
26974	pos	I've been looking for a similar place in town but have had no such luck.
26975	pos	So my wife loves Swiss Chalet's rotisserie chicken and overall this restaurant has done that fairly well.
26976	pos	If you want a positive dining experience, come see for yourself.
26977	neg	After reading reviews of their dealers, I decided to go elsewhere.
26978	neg	Immediately I took pictures and walked into the store to report the incident.
26979	pos	They were well done!
26980	pos	Nothing too over-complicated.
26981	pos	It was as if I was back in Phnom Penh eating at one of their restaurants off the riverside.
26982	neg	If you want a large menu with pasta & steaks, this is not the place.
26983	neg	The chow at Perk isn't so good because of a lengthy and expensive ingredient list, or because of cutting edge culinary technique.
26984	neg	"It was a mess.Pump bad.Water leaking from inlet and was not
Level at all and very dirty."
26985	pos	So thinly sliced and lovingly arranged, came out within 5 minutes.
26986	neg	I'd advise you to eat at home, or at least let the restaurant remake your meal/drink.)
26987	pos	We were warmed the portion sizes were small but we got full--guess it depends on your appetite.
26988	pos	The cashier who recommended this to me said she had eaten two orders plus a pork belly sandwich--and it was barely 11am!
26989	neg	You'll be bankrupted for life, but you will be alive.
26990	neg	The only thing I was not a huge fan of was fried Zucchini.
26991	pos	I can't think of any topping I was missing.
26992	neg	I spent more than 6K on furniture at this particular Living Spaces, they deliver all damage furniture to me the first time.
26993	pos	So many people told me this place has the best chicken.
26994	pos	I remember this one time, my friend and I asked for  doggy bags... for my chicken fried rice - they drew a chicken and for my friends shrimp fried rice they drew a shrimp!
26995	pos	Then when we were about to leave I asked for a box so I could take the bread to go so that we could snack on it later.

""Great food, service, clean and very spacious place to eat""



""Staff was friendly, food was good and plenty of tables to sit in."""
26997	neg	I lived in Italy for 5 years and in the ten years since, I have gotten used to the idea that I will not find any authentic Italian cuisine in the states.
26998	pos	If you go to Gastonia and don't go to Tonys then you need to turn around!
26999	neg	There was dust all over our room.
27000	pos	Some of the highlights were an excellent bacon wrapped chicken (yep, tastes just like it sounds) and pretty good flank steak, which was tender and juicy.
27001	neg	Food is moderate a best.
27002	pos	"to be fair, there are of course ""normal"" dishes by western estimations that are quite approachable and executed precisely."
27003	neg	I drop off the vehicle, asking for a call if repairs exceed a certain amount... and later that day I get the dreaded call.
27004	neg	We ordered two shots of tequila to put into our drinks so they weren't so sweet.
27005	neg	But todays delivery driver was super rude.
27006	pos	Next time, I'll up the ante!
27007	neg	It is also way harder to do certain steps without the support of the barre!
27008	neg	I can usually deal with one or two small things wrong because I understand they have a lot of rooms.
27009	pos	I've ordered desserts at high end restaurants that didn't come together as well as this did, and it was part of a dessert buffet bar.
27010	neg	So this dealership is nearly double the normal rate in Phoenix and surrounding area.
27011	neg	No se quien sea la dueña oh dueño, pero creo k nesecitan mostrar un poquito de respeto y simpatia hacia el consumidor.
27012	neg	My least favorite appetizer was the mac and cheese.
27013	pos	We got the quseo dip recommended by the waiter and other yelp reviews.
27014	neg	If you don't want to spend money don't go here or any of them.
27015	neg	They had clearly been cooked a long time and seemingly without boiling.
27016	pos	Another associate had  family there and was very help with them.
27017	neg	Next dish grossed me out badly.
27018	pos	Dogs bark that what they do.
27019	pos	Great place for a laid back drinks night.
27020	pos	This place is killer!!!
27021	pos	I was excited when we arrived as every booth was filled.
27022	neg	We need stronger coffee here.
27023	pos	I live around the corner And usually there is a friendly face.
27024	neg	When I got there they had me for a totally different size van that I'd asked for.
27025	pos	I was really excited to see that they had chicken and waffles on the menu.
27026	pos	He told me no one pays when you go to his restaurant.
27027	neg	I got a smaller one that didn't hold up well because I got it on the lower arm and it is too active of an area (I think).
27028	pos	Drove 40 min to get my nails done every two weeks by Kevin because he is THE BEST!
27029	pos	I will be
27030	pos	And she giggled.
27031	pos	Okay, fine.
27032	pos	The mechanics were nice, and I have no reason to think the oil change was done inefficiently.
27033	pos	What a novel concept.
27034	pos	Nearby there is awesome Mexican place.
27035	pos	Menu has a narrow range of items that are sure to fit anyone with a palette for fish.
27036	pos	I walked in with a defective item bought across town a week ago with no receipt.
27037	pos	I called ahead and the tech was there when I pulled up.
27038	neg	We had tried to clean the dumb thing a few times over the past year or two and all attempts were total failures.
27039	pos	The guitar came on time, in perfect condition & in a protective box.
27040	pos	2. chicken tacos- that peanut BBQ sauce was HEAVENLY.
27041	pos	After first visiting with the friendly, professional staff and touring the beautiful property, I knew my search was over.
27042	pos	Here's the surprise the food arrives right after the soup,right after.
27043	pos	Parking and location was fine.
27044	pos	After putting me on hold for 10 minutes he said yes they could match it.
27045	pos	This is NOT Tex-Mex, its real flavors that some of the best dining in Mexico has to offer.
27046	neg	They have cameras ...I hope they take a look at this.
27047	pos	It wasn't very busy at 1pm on a Monday afternoon.
27048	pos	Which is 100% alright.
27049	neg	I ordered mine with the thick noodle; however, I would suggest ordering this dish with the thin noodle.
27050	neg	Ive been going to cherry for over a year now and i still hadn't found a go to lash artist .
27051	pos	My seats were at the top row and I had plenty of room.
27052	neg	After driving around to 3 different auto shops to ask about just changing my head light all places told me I would have to pay to remove my battery to access the light.
27053	neg	She wasn't able to deliver my daughter due to a family emergency.
27054	pos	I was a frequent visitor when they first opened and enjoyed the menu variety.
27055	neg	Unfortunately the only places that makes it like that are usually high end Italian restaurants, but then it becomes an event.
27056	pos	I ordered the small fries and then they pour more into my bag before giving me my order...
27057	neg	There's no food, but what do you need food for?
27058	pos	They never use MSG, food tastes fresher and service is excellent.
27059	pos	I've been wanting to try them, but they're out in Bainbridge and I just don't go out that way very often.
27060	neg	I am very picky with my steak, not many places can prepare it to my liking.
27061	neg	Like Matt W. mentioned, it's full of Stoughton residents, and a table of older ladies helped us navigate making a hot chocolate at the coffee bar (which I don't recommend btw) because the person behind the counter would barely talk to us.
27062	pos	So detail oriented.
27063	pos	Came in with an iPhone 4 cracked screen and left with a replaced screen and got my phone color changed black to white, and with a screen protector thrown in.
27064	pos	I had my car towed and fixed at half the cost.
27065	pos	Too bad, because they are a great restaurant with great food and atmosphere.
27066	neg	I don't want you to get arrested for stolen vehicle.
27067	pos	Well, this guy, Eytan I guess, couldnt have been nicer.
27068	pos	The rep in garage was super nice.
27069	pos	I'm can put down a lot of food but no me and my wife were perfectly satisfied with sharing the potato.
27070	pos	As a spoiled CA girl, I've had much better at home - but these were an interesting choice.
27071	neg	Chef cuts the bag open to heat and doesn't bother to get the cut piece out of the pot!!!
27072	neg	Not sure what the show is about but I've heard things that are bizarre.
27073	pos	Nothing over $5 bucks and you get more for your money.
27074	neg	Sometimes it's difficult to find someone to assist me.)
27075	neg	I don't like to sell stuff on ebay anymore because of the hassle and all the fees.
27076	neg	I went to a lot of places and they wanted to charge me up to 500 dollars and some of they would promise me more and try to add more stuff to my tax in order to get me more and for them to keep profit.
27077	pos	If you use another carpet cleaning company, you are making a mistake.
27078	pos	I'm Steve F and I approve this message.
27079	neg	I believe the chef is better at cooking then making desserts.
27080	neg	They get you into a contract and they know you can't quit.
27081	pos	The queso at Cabo Wabo was of decent consistency, with pico de gallo sprinkled on top.
27082	pos	"All the Management could say about the experience was ""It is what it is."""
27083	pos	That one bite made me crave a new culture of food I couldn't believe I have never tried.
27084	neg	"Upon arriving, I was a little skeptical as the building looks like an old house and not ""spa-ish""."
27085	pos	Basking in its glory under the heat lamps caught the eyes of students too cool to be concerned over nutrition value.
27086	pos	The mint sorbet tasted like they picked it straight from the garden.
27087	pos	So save room for some red bean ice cream or mochi.
27088	pos	Also on right corner they have little corner ( Not very little ) cafe where you are served food.
27089	pos	This is one of those places that I wish I had stopped sooner!
27090	pos	I say amazing because the staff never even told me of its existence, much less that it has a coveted Michelin star.
27091	neg	Very upsetting.
27092	pos	If Disney World did a sushi restaurant, it would probably look like this.
27093	neg	They claim it's because people didn't like it because *somehow* they couldn't figure out that it was going to be bitter.
27094	pos	The place is large inside and never really busy.
27095	pos	Sit at the bar for a quick meal.
27096	pos	Maybe my taste is not so well developed.
27097	neg	I own a black car and it's almost impossible to get all the water spots off, I usually always end up wiping my car down when I get home.
27098	pos	We were promptly seated and our order was taken.
27099	neg	My only complaint was with me.
27100	pos	Of course we also have patrons that can not be bothered to xerox a few pages and decided to ripe out entire section on sauces and dips in Nobu's cookbook that is beautiful enough to be a coffee table book.
27101	neg	This is GO-TIME for restaurants in the Vegas Valley, the fact that the management can't have the foresight to FULLY staff their restaurant during the busiest time of the day and week is absurd.
27102	pos	If you are envisioning greasy fried chicken with soggy, limp waffles - you have to completely rethink things.
27103	neg	My only (small) complaint was that the soft serve was a bit icy.
27104	pos	Everything tasted as if it was made from scratch.
27105	pos	1lbs shrimp (good size shrimp).
27106	neg	I thought I had ordered the one in the hot pot but I guess i asked for the wrong one?
27107	neg	I purchased a brand new (less expensive) computer and of course it was slow as soon as I got it up and running.
27108	pos	He was so apologetic that he was booked and couldn't send someone out until the morning.
27109	pos	I was tempted to order the beer battered salmon tacos but I'll save that for another Thursday.
27110	pos	The walls must have been well insulated and thick because we heard nothing from anyone or anything at all during our three-day stay.
27111	neg	What also sucks is that I had 2 cavities now - on the tooth in front of this crown and the one behind it.
27112	pos	Holy Moly!!!!!!
27113	neg	I then sat in the hygiene chair with Polli and was appalled to find that she was chiming in on the horrible comments about Dr Anderson.
27114	pos	Le prix de l'abonnement au mois peut sembler élevé mais quand on voit le service derrière ça vaut le coup !
27115	pos	The staff could not have been friendlier.
27116	pos	I was going to sit outside, but the host recommended the bar if I was getting drinks.
27117	neg	My friend from work had a drained/dead battery.
27118	pos	Maybe both?
27119	pos	Not only that but the chef himself came out to apologize and also gave us a free canoli.
27120	neg	Later they changed their story to that they couldn't scan them, but I didn't ask for scanning per se (but I did need it also and just hadn't remembered to ask for it).
27121	pos	"Spicy scrambled eggs were cooked well with a nice flavor profile, but not near spicy enough to have ""spicy"" in the name."
27122	pos	Purchased dozen of cakes and rcvd 1 free.
27123	pos	We were so excited because this is our first big purchase together.
27124	pos	It was in an old house so it was charming (but drafty!
27125	neg	Our app plates (the ones the food came on, not the small bread plates) were never cleared from the table even though one held nothing but discarded corn cobs.
27126	pos	I don't know why my curiosity gets me to try different clubs instead of  just coming here for my dance relief.
27127	neg	Parking lot is full all the time.
27128	pos	Close quarters are remedied with booths for larger groups, two and four top tables, bar service and couches and chairs at just the right height for coffee table sharing.
27129	neg	I just wish they would add fresh produce at this location.
27130	neg	I hope Chipotle brings back the soft corn tortillas because I know I will probably rarely come to Chipotle if they don't.
27131	pos	Please do not change anything about this place.
27132	pos	We showed up at 11:45 am and we're called to be seated at 11:55  which was not bad at all for how busy they were .
27133	neg	I dreaded going to the BMV on my lunch break (on a Monday, to boot!)
27134	neg	I thought it would be fun for a one off event, but not really a place I would get excited about.
27135	neg	Every place I went had hot hot hot women's shoes, but the men's shoes were so boring and department store-like.
27136	pos	They memorized my order after only 2 times.
27137	neg	Honestly, it was the negative Yelp reviews that really held me back.
27138	pos	And it's not tough like most prime rib I've eaten at.
27139	pos	i walked in and was like daaaaamn!!
27140	pos	I hate to say this, but I have gone elsewhere in an attempt to find something closer to Columbus, Ohio (where I currently live), but nothing compares.
27141	pos	"(pink is where its at)

We ordered our drinks first, I ordered the margarita (which was just ok, BUT when I asked for extra tequila, the server hooked a sister up!)"
27142	neg	One thing to watch out for is their parking lot.
27143	neg	It was in perfect condition and the salesperson made me feel really bad for returning it.
27144	neg	And the taste was a little off; almost on the stale side, but the bag showed a November expiration date.
27145	neg	I ate a Mediterranean Brochette with Shrimp on it and the shrimp was weird.
27146	neg	And based on the reviews of the other company, I believe I would have been charged a lot more had I stuck with them, in addition to the $100 service call fee.
27147	pos	Not a detail was spared.
27148	pos	Our server Ian was ON POINT!!
27149	neg	.but the sweetness lasted througout and it kind of made it weird for me.
27150	pos	The Canadian was insane!
27151	neg	And some stores always seem rude and pushy.
27152	pos	If you have a players card give it to the waiter for 10% off your bill.
27153	neg	In those 10 days I haven't had a meal that I would classify past substandard.
27154	neg	While I usually love all things hazelnut, this was not that great.
27155	neg	Then two cars pull to the other lane over and they help them first!
27156	pos	They took my situation more seriously than I did and they had products to help me out.
27157	pos	In Winnipeg, the broccoli have a great sauce, the rice is amazing - you can't stop eating, and the meat is more meat than flour.
27158	pos	Nice and warm.
27159	pos	First time I was there, I bought an engagement ring and had an excellent experience.
27160	neg	I recently had a slab leak which is about the worst news you can get as far as plumbing problems.
27161	pos	Unbelievable boba smoothies.
27162	pos	I could have sat there for a week and not get bored.
27163	neg	And the people in the parking lot suffer road rage.
27164	pos	We hosted a huge event here for 300 people and had pretty high expectations based on the reviews and other recommendations.
27165	pos	I felt like I was in the movie Scarface Very Bling Bling!
27166	pos	I enjoyed a happy hour drink with a snack, tasty, at the bar and had a nice positive, service experience.
27167	pos	When deciding where to go for our February Girls Night, after considering other favorites, we settled on BLT, as it had been a few months since we enjoyed their happy hour.
27168	pos	My cousin and I say we will try something else the next time we go but why mess with a good thing?
27169	neg	I only give them a star for actually doing what they needed to do to make good (even though he was a complete jackass about it) and not totally shirking me.
27170	pos	Came to get drinks for my nephews and I.
27171	pos	Probably the BEST example of the above and beyond customer service, was the fact that our 03 vehicle had a leak in the rear light bar that caused it to no longer work (water does that with electronics).
27172	neg	It's a step BELOW a Super 8 or a Days Inn.
27173	neg	"There is BLOOD!"""

29270	pos	DANGEROUSLY ADDICTIVE.
29271	neg	It's in a strip mall with some very busy stores and restaurants so patience is needed on that front.
29272	pos	I know this because the chocolate cake I ordered was enough to feed 3 people and caught the attention of everyone within 5 tables.
29273	neg	They happened to be Oreos and rainbow sprinkles (I am from Boston so I do call the black ones jimmies, but they didn't have jimmies, sadly).
29274	pos	Polite employees too.
29275	pos	I had just had a great workout and wanted some fresh, flavorful food to eat for lunch.
29276	neg	As to the pineapple upside down cake: if you like the gooey, saturated, sickeningly sweet variety that is chockfull of preservatives (and topped with pineapple slice and maraschino cherry that date from the first Bush administration), head to your nearest supermarket.

1) The sashimi was very fresh, however , there were only total 6 pieces of sashimi."
29299	neg	The breakfast leaves a bit to be desired, but I really don't expect breakfast in a hotel, since I rarely eat it when I'm at home (and it's free, really, you get what you pay for).

29301	pos	They offer unlimited mimosas ($12) and Bloody Marys ($8) for a steal, if that's your thing.

29305	neg	Especially when it comes to nails and I'm trying to explain or describe something to someone and they don't understand... Uhhhh that's a problem!
29306	pos	The salon gets a star for their honest attempt at making the decor cute, but hopefully they invest in some real salon chairs.

29330	neg	( I really lacked on this one, I ate prior to the hike, but all that uphill really took a toll on my energy.
29331	pos	(You know a cigar store is legit if they carry Davidoff, AND a selection off cheap, but good quality un-labeled cigars).

29354	pos	The kids meal came out in 3 minutes.
29355	pos	The first time this happened, the owner Chris was really good about making sure they paid to have our pool shocked and treated.

33648	pos	for the record... cabo fish taco has never been closed due to food poisoning!!!!!

33711	neg	When I asked the waiter what I had to do to get the 25% off the bill, he said it expired at the end of Sept. Hmmmmm, it really should be accepted as long as it's on Yelp, or taken off ASAP.

34206	pos	We have friends that consistently rave about this place, but then again they think Macaroni grill is the best Italian going!

34221	pos	You can taste the lemon grass in every bite.
34222	pos	They found a vein just fine.
34223	pos	Each pancake is also $1.50 a piece - you could easily pay for it with the spare change you have in your wallet!

34244	pos	You can usually spot half a dozen people writing in their journals or sketching while they try to stretch their maws wide enough to accommodate the freshly baked sandwich bread.
34245	pos	No real surprise here, that is why I have serviced my last 4 VWs with VW North Scottsdale and Mr. Porter for the past 10 years.
34246	neg	CHECK YOUR ORDER BEFORE YOU LEAVE!
34247	pos	I could write a sonnet about the freshly made chips.
34248	pos	Instead, real thought went into basics like the vibe and general look and feel of the place, their relatively small but quite tasty and well-priced menu, their friendly staff, and even the layout of their main stage area.
34249	pos	The only take thing I could think to complain about is the parking.

34256	pos	As soon as we walked in, it was empty and we got service quickly.
34257	neg	Should never take 25 minutes like it did today.
34258	pos	We were chatting with Bob and he just made us drinks based on what we were telling him we liked.
34259	neg	Me and my husband and a friend stopped in for a bite to eat, there was no HOSTESS at the door but a sign that said please wait to be seated.. after standing there for about a minute a young lady at the bar seen us standing there she was pouring drink she looked up and said I will be with you in one second.

34293	pos	Redeeming qualities are desert, pasta bar, and salad bar.

34313	pos	How efffing thoughtfull!!

34347	pos	Oh and if you get caught checking out your cute gaucho, fret not.

34354	pos	I wanted more but we ordered so much I thought better to leave it til my next visit.
34355	neg	Now I know that sometimes when merchandise is damaged they will move it to the discount rack, but there's a difference between missing a few buttons and being shredded.
34356	neg	Beware - It's hard to get a table if you arrive late!
34357	pos	If you're in the mood to experiment sit in the carpet room and enjoy your dinner.
34358	neg	There is no effort to ensure you get to your destination and the drivers choice to pick a fare makes you, a paying customer, an option.
34359	neg	That was a big mistake!
34360	pos	My daughter was very excited to visit this establishment for a birthday surprise.
34361	pos	Same customers and atmosphere but the aervice is excellent.
34362	pos	I'm pretty confident that we didn't get VIP treatment and am very ok with that, I just don't you to view my opinion as skewed.
34363	pos	If I have to complain about something, it has to be the bacon.

34370	pos	Do yourself a favor and try some new Indian dishes at Minerva
34371	pos	Other than just the instances in the poker room there are many other reasons I choose Hollywood over horseshoe!
34372	neg	We came here once before, but my husband didn't like it.
34373	pos	The service was nice, but again it could be because there were only a few people there.
34374	pos	We said thank you and she actually responded with your welcome.
34375	pos	The list goes on.
34376	neg	My review is only for the Craft Beer Selection which overall I find very lacking in Las Vegas.
34377	pos	So the third time I went I request to see Brenda again and I got her paws painted.

34379	pos	So my friends slept in the comfy bathrobe with the sheets.
34380	pos	They had 3 tables occupied.
34381	pos	I attended a class for many weeks and saw amazing results.
34382	pos	I did just  that and decided it  could be a car for my daughter if the price was right.
34383	pos	If you want great financing go see the fine people at AutoNation Buick GMC, they WILL find you a good deal, if it takes all day.
34384	pos	I loved this place because I had amazing health insurance at the time so I happily paid $400 for 2 pairs of glasses which would have cost us $1500 out of pocket.
34385	pos	I wish she could beat my face everyday.
34386	neg	Once we arrived we almost turned around as there were no other customers in the restaurant and it always seems odd to me to eat in an empty place.
34387	neg	EMAIL IS ALWAYS DOWN MORE THAN ANY OTHER WEB HOST IVE EXPERIENCED.
34388	pos	This was the 3rd time I have gone here.
34389	pos	Bueno.
34390	neg	I used to go to China go go because it was closer to my house but the quality has gone so down hill.
34391	pos	I even remember the fancy little zipper case it came in and the colorful brochure inside.
34392	neg	I've been waiting for a restaurant worthy of the East Valley Korean title belt; hodori and chodang always fell a bit short.
34393	pos	We heard such good things about Kaya...
34394	neg	On a weekend and close to Christmas, I can see parking being a problem.
34395	pos	It was almost as if they were actually in my room right next to me.

34406	pos	Ambience is also plesant
34407	pos	that they brought us felt like a bargain (it was $48.50) and we struggled to finish it (the others at the table were not into the force fed goose liver thing) and managed to get down about 4 oz.
34408	neg	It's about an hour and a half or so, so I wouldn't recommend if your in a rush.

34417	pos	We have never had chicken taste so much like chicken!
34418	neg	The whole place has a feeling of being overwhelmed.
34419	pos	She insisted to take it off the bill.
34420	neg	It's really disappointing because getting our nails done  is a treat for us, and something we all look forward to doing together.
34421	neg	We actually had plans to visit BeerHause next door but decided to come here since we didn't receive any service after sitting for 10mins.
34422	pos	The customer service is friendly and the portions are pretty reasonable considering how most chipotles are very light handed.
34423	pos	Definitely sending more work there way.
34424	pos	The hike down is much more grueling and hard on the body.
34425	pos	We've been customers with Sparkletts for over 10 years!
34426	pos	Thanks and have a fantastic day!

34428	pos	I wish I knew about this place before.
34429	neg	She said that they ran out of batter...I believe it was the owner that heard this and he said 'oh you want fish?
34430	neg	Served as a meal with a generous portion of succulent irresistible COLD A#% FRENCH FRIES!??
34431	neg	A salad with feta and tomato slices shouldn't run upwards of $10, especially in Phoenix, but it tasted fine.

""Great food, service, clean and very spacious place to eat""



""Staff was friendly, food was good and plenty of tables to sit in."""
34434	pos	Nine rolls and not a one was a disappointment.
34435	pos	WOW, enough food for 2 people and delicious.
34436	neg	On second thought, maybe just don't do that at all.
34437	pos	These managers know how to run a business.
34438	pos	The service is always exceptiona,.especially if you get Margarita as your server.
34439	pos	They have several tv's and all are not on the same channel which is a goo thing.
34440	neg	Someone got picked to be on stage and had to climb over us, and while doing so knocked over someone's full beer.
34441	neg	She wasn't too pleasant AGAIN!
34442	pos	"It may be nothing more than ""glorified fish sticks"" accompanied by ""watered down ketchup"", but dammit that watered down ketchup has el pato sauce in it and the fish sticks are much larger than the kind you buy at the store, plus they are deep fried."
34443	pos	I then went to Home Depot and the lady behind the counter matched the paint in about 5 minutes.
34444	neg	On other hand, you may never want to eat fajitas again.
34445	neg	Without the salty sauce, the pasta may taste bland, since there isn't much of other content besides the mushrooms.
34446	neg	No adult swings, only 4 baby ones.
34447	pos	First impression.
34448	neg	I greatly dislike sweet and sour food combos, I don't like sweet elements in a savory dish.
34449	pos	I've already given in to the chocolate and banana version of you and I fear my self control won't last much longer.
34450	neg	At the house, we have a cockroach problem...I know the envy you feel in your heart, or maybe its' revulsion is huge but it is an irrigated lot and there are way more of them than there of me.
34451	pos	Without going into detail, I enjoyed a rustic view for the remainder of the night.
34452	pos	I left feeling full but not stuffed.
34453	pos	I really wish I could give a better review, everyone at the salon is very nice - they provide a fun atmosphere and when Sam was here my hair always looked great, the cut and color were perfect.
34454	neg	The waiting area was really crowded and there were a lot of strong perfumy smells from waiting patients.
34455	neg	Located in the Venetian with its own elevator from the casino level, Bouchon leaves little to be desired.
34456	pos	Before we were served I asked the waitress about the free Marg when you Check In and she said she would honor it even though the coupon to pop up on my phone.
34457	neg	They don't have to worry about pushing me away anymore, I'm more than happy to stay away now!
34458	neg	Somehow everything I actually wanted before the fridge she had neglected to account for.
34459	pos	I happily went down to Scottsdale gun club where they treated me right.

34465	neg	And, to be honest, Asian food is not really a favorite of mine.
34466	pos	The seasoned fries are good which isn't a good thing for me and my bikini so I pass on that goodness MOST of the time.
34467	pos	My thinking of what this place does/why it is still open is because it is the closest pizza delivery service that is open 24hr.
34468	pos	The people watching at this bar is second to none.
34469	pos	Could not wait to eat at the Pink Taco on my trip to Vegas.
34470	neg	The owner cannot do enough for you.
34471	pos	He deserves a star on his own.
34472	pos	I undersold this place in my earlier review.
34473	neg	"There is no grand amounts of ""filler"" for the rolls like rice or minced crabstick."
34474	neg	When ordering soup, beware...
34475	pos	The only way to make a good bagel.
34476	pos	All my emails and calls were returned within the hour.
34477	pos	When my family arrived, we addressed it with Kyle who was severely apologetic, and offered to help us switch tables, which we didn't think necessary, we just asked for some rags or for some napkins to wipe it off ourselves.
34478	neg	I normally dislike going to the dentist like most people.
34479	pos	Food was tasty.
34480	pos	"""Have a nice day,"" as I walked out of the store."
34481	neg	Short ribs looked like kind of a small serving but I think it was because of the size of the plate.
34482	neg	Don't care, cheap cocktails and Midwestern bitterness save the day.
34483	pos	"She ""fixed"" my daughters hair and then after my showing her where it was still crooked a couple times -it was corrected."
34484	pos	I have been many, many times but always get the same thing.
34485	pos	Usually things flow pretty well.
34486	pos	3) You nearly go mad because you're too indecisive to pick which other two items you want out of the four or five sides that look totally delicious.
34487	pos	The rooms were small and dark- which I am completely fine with- and the beds were warm.
34488	neg	Surprised how they've stayed in business so long.
34489	pos	Food was great, A+ !!!
34490	pos	Fresh green onions and basil make it pop right before it gets to you.
34491	pos	The washrooms are clean and the decor is nice.
34492	neg	There is no excuse to not accept cards nowadays; Geez, you can accept cards on smart phones, it's that easy!!!
34493	neg	I was here from 9:40 to 3:30pm to get one regular haircut!
34494	pos	We would gladly vote for a Little John's Lawn services to be selected as #1 Landscaping Company of Gilbert and Chandler areas and definitely giving them our THUMBS UP!
34495	pos	And the certified pre-owned cars already come with extended warranties.
34496	pos	I'll continue buying cars there until either I can't drive anymore or the zombies attack.
34497	pos	Can't wait!!!
34498	pos	Sitting in the back is best.
34499	pos	I wish there is more than 5 stats to give you.
34500	neg	When I got my GMC truck I was devastated- my Mechanic was Hon Man, best Honda mechanic in town, and he doesn't touch GMC.
34501	neg	I dont know why it is that hard to cook brown rice but you'd be suprised.
34502	pos	Good place for drinks but definitely eat at home.
34503	neg	Of course, on the rental agreement, they omit some of their fees.
34504	pos	Honestly even the prices are a perfect match to the food at every Viva Chicken.
34505	pos	My old card would get me free valet anytime.
34506	pos	The iced tea was a winner!
34507	pos	I spent the day road tripping from New York to Chicago, and this place came from a recommendation from a (now former) friend.
34508	pos	Found one we loved.
34509	pos	I then asked the bartender can you call in and reserve bar seats & she said yes.
34510	neg	I was not a fan of the fontina burger I ordered it because it was a diners drive in's dives favorite.
34511	neg	Husband speaks to manager.
34512	pos	"""You can plug in your laptop if you'd like, and work!"""
34513	neg	LOVED Bad Water, but they have unfortunately sold the business and are no longer open
34514	pos	The waitress was a pretty Asian girl who always checked up on us to make sure things were good and cleared our table often since we ordered plenty but the table space was limited.
34515	pos	I have never had Buffalo and I must say I have been missing out.
34516	neg	I woke up Sunday more hungover than I've been in 20 years (cheap premium booze).
34517	neg	I've never complain their service even waiting for a long time under AZ heat in the summer (one time I waited for 2 hours).
34518	pos	The burger was good.
34519	pos	Strudel was fine.
34520	pos	1st the margaritas are amazing!!!
34521	pos	At 6:30, I finally had the medicine in my possession.
34522	pos	We paired dessert with coffee, and if presentation is any indication of the quality at Harbour Sixty, the coffee platter said it all.
34523	neg	Don't come during peak hours because you'll probably wait 45mins for a table.
34524	neg	Given the long line, it makes me wonder if most people like their food more than I do.
34525	pos	Bought mustang convertible top June 1, 2015.
34526	neg	I always was a huge fan of Fat Bastard but they have gone downhill the past year.
34527	neg	The food was competent if not average.
34528	pos	Lovely restaurant.
34529	pos	The soy-namis, are a vegan blizzard alternative that are way better imo.
34530	pos	and promised me an upgrade for the remainder of my term and the next year to Gold without charge to me.
34531	pos	I love stand up comedy and also went to Sin City Comedy which was hiiii-larious.
34532	pos	Nice place.
34533	neg	If you're still reading this and happen to be in Sin City, don't waste your time with strip clown promoters.
34534	neg	Just an example I ruined 2 silk shirts by washing them.
34535	neg	you probably won't like The Black Dog's atmosphere because you'll think the servers, host or bartenders are rude for not falling all over themselves to do your bidding.
34536	pos	The Staff: Laid back and unobtrusive.
34537	pos	Best place to get an eye exam!!
34538	neg	I caught him once on the initial signing and was able to correct it ($900 warranty that I stated I did not want).
34539	pos	"""Mekong Plaza"" is one of the finest Oriental shopping center In Mesa (my opinion)."
34540	neg	There wasn't much that could be done since you can't fix nails that are so uneven from a gel removal gone wrong.
34541	neg	My least favorite was the roasted lobster which was served over rice with sea urchin and asian flavors.. it just didn't appeal to me.
34542	neg	When I sat down I was facing Louis Vuitton and that was odd.
34543	neg	A friend came out and begged us to stay, so we decided to bite the bullet and pay cover (the last time we had went it sucked so we were apprehensive).
34544	neg	Never get regular nachos at Tribe game again.
34545	neg	I like this place but they closed without notice today.
34546	neg	Industrial décor does not set this mood.
34547	pos	We went with the recommendation of our waiter, and I strongly advise you listen to their expertise!
34548	pos	When you lifted a slice it all rolled off......nice.
34549	pos	Oh, the room itself is great - king studio suite with a desk, sofa, full bathroom with jacuzzi tub, and kitchenette.
34550	pos	It's too bad too, because they have pretty decent food and we wanted to share it with our family.
34551	neg	Third Issue - We completely understand that the 4th of July in Las Vegas is going to be one big party.
34552	pos	It was good.
34553	pos	I was told they only use what they believe in which to me tells me they are confident with what they use.
34554	neg	I had not eaten anything else since noon so I'm confident it was this dinner that got me.
34555	pos	Not only was there no sound of annoyance from their end of the line but they even went out of their way to take care of me as a customer.
34556	neg	The parking lot is a little tight, in terms of getting in and out of the spaces and by the gas pumps.
34557	pos	If there is a better recommendation than bringing knives 2,000 miles to have them sharpened by a real pro I can't think of it.
34558	pos	We'll be going back on our next visit and I'm ordering the exact same thing.
34559	pos	Apparently my friend has never been here before, and I decided I would be a terrible friend if I never took him.

34565	pos	After all the commotion we get moved into the penthouse suite.
34566	pos	Slow Braised Rib was decent.
34567	neg	Despite the small space and limited stock.
34568	neg	One star they post right away, 5 stars they need to review it LOL Unbelievable.
34569	pos	However, once I took my first bite, my body completely melted.
34570	pos	It's not in a fancy area like Wurst is (Mission... probably one of the most expensive neighborhoods in the city) but is superior in taste.
34571	pos	Kaeleb was even there when I went to pick up my hard drive two days later to ensure that everything would run soothly.
34572	pos	My truck looked like a brand new vehicle out of the showroom.
34573	pos	Five bucks extra for the prix fixe, but the service was superb, the food was great--PLUS they have a patio, which Midi lacks.
34574	neg	Maybe too much.
34575	pos	The rooms are fairly large; 16 X 18 feet and a 2 room combo of 15 X 34 feet.
34576	pos	I love spicy, so I opted for the chili sauce with it,  but I ended up not even using it because it covered up the crazy flavor of the stir fry.
34577	pos	They were pretty good and I ate there all the time.
34578	neg	The one thing that I had a bit of trouble with was the price of the sauce.
34579	neg	After ordering a chocolate milk, the milk came to me warm and they had thrown some ice in it to cool it down.
34580	pos	Was very excited about getting the Bolognese ragu pasta...
34581	pos	I usually do a Pro's / Con's review, but I can't think of a single con other than the fact that you may have to wait a couple of weeks if you are not flexible in order to get an appointment because they stay booked.
34582	pos	I found the food to be between 3.5 to 4.5 stars, depending on the dish, enough points to earn my revisit.
34583	neg	It was too fancy and I couldn't just go there and pickup.
34584	neg	It was like eating a bird's nest with caviar and egg.
34585	neg	I also think the aisles could be just a little wider.
34586	neg	Price:  Expensive!
34587	pos	My daughter was seen within minutes and was tested and it came back that she just had a viral infection which we suspected.
34588	neg	It's not your top of line high class sort of thing but the movies aren't so why would the play?
34589	neg	I will say, a place that gets this busy needs more seating.
34590	neg	Next time I'll get shrimp instead of beef, I think it would just go together better.
34591	neg	"You should see a different one."""
34592	pos	Very fast that way, no wait!
34593	pos	They call this endless which means if you are like me, you could eat about 8 pounds of this stuff.
34594	neg	Hopefully will they will take responsibility this time.
34595	neg	Skeptical at first as they were on tap.
34596	pos	I liked that added value because I felt later down the road I could afford to buy a nicer diamond.
34597	neg	The last thing anyone wants when dining out is car fumes passing them by along with all the traffic noise.
34598	neg	It was a bit hard to find and didn't realize that you could get to the elevators from the garage area instead of walking all around in circles.
34599	neg	Their current design is very inefficient and confusing.
34600	neg	The decor needs a little improvement.
34601	neg	Even though I turned off the dryer almost immediately (as fast as I could while fumbling over the switch), my boy remained out of control, reacting to dryer noises on the other side of the shop.
34602	pos	Their uni was butter in my mouth.
34603	neg	I think it ruined other steaks for me which sucks.
34604	neg	No day off.
34605	pos	While the pulled pork sample was good, I had to order the brisket sandwich.
34606	neg	Not the best location to find.
34607	pos	It's incredible how similar the meat substitutes taste compared to the real thing.
34608	neg	The sangria wasn't all that honestly but I can never find a place that serves sangria or wants to make me one (it isn't that hard!)
34609	pos	They told me that I needed to get my rack and pinion replaced to the tune of $1600.
34610	pos	It wasn't that great, but it wasn't bad.
34611	pos	"It literally is epitome of ""don't judge a book by it's cover""."
34612	pos	Will definitely come again.
34613	neg	"In person, I once again calmly explained what had happened and showed my MVD ""service adviser"" my proof (including my letters, prior registrations...the whole wad that I had brought along...just in case)."
34614	pos	I've been lucky enough to eat at 3 other locations, all in Southern California, but this was is different in that you're inside a mall.
34615	pos	I did not have one person but two experts working on my hair.
34616	neg	"Normally I would let it slide but I was already getting quite ""hangry"" so I called to lodge a complaint (because they had missed this exact condiment in the past)."
34617	neg	In my experience, most of the contractors are not the best at communicating and it may take multiple follow ups before hearing back from them.
34618	neg	Few things I'd recommend staying away from that were pretty boring - the calamari, shrimp, asparagus, and pork belly just did nothing for me.
34619	neg	The only bad class I've taken was with Rachel.

34739	neg	Maybe it's cause they're still new and don't have a lot of desserts on rotation yet.
34740	pos	We got gel manis and regular pedis and they did a top quality job and then I got hit with the bill.
34741	neg	We have baklava which was good, but a bit stale considering it was sitting for the whole day.
34742	pos	We have come to this location on numerous occasions and have always had great service followed by great food.
34743	neg	At lunch, Rusan's has their sushi sit out buffet-style, which to me is unacceptable for seafood.

34745	neg	The wait was quite a bit long for their lunch time rush.
34746	pos	good.

34751	neg	Wish the prices were not so high.
34752	pos	Leave it to the French to make great French Fries.
34753	neg	Only con for me- I would've liked some steak and seafood combos without having to get two whole separate entrees, like steam topped with lobster- but that wasn't an option when we went.
34754	pos	I got it to go but once I got in the the car the smell overtook me and I ate it right there in the parking lot.
34755	pos	Also, for some reason, the iced tea here is unsually good ... maybe there's something special about it.
34756	pos	No one can touch them.
34757	neg	I'm surprise this place is still open.
34758	neg	This place should of been one of those mmm mm places but its a front for a restaurant, for restaurant prices.

34760	pos	He even told us that we could get cases and screen protectors for all 4 phones for $20 all together.
34761	neg	We get to the Palomino Club and the driver try's to leave without checking us into the club.
34762	neg	My only nit is that they don't carry enough fragrance-free shampoo and conditioner for the size of the store.
34763	pos	The good things were the bacon, which is hard to screw up; the lemonade was good; and fries were very crispy.
34764	neg	They will say anything to you to protect themselves.
34765	pos	If you're looking for a great dentist in Phoenix, call her office!

I was excited to bring my sister here for the 1st time."
34769	neg	You might have a problem with communication... as there is a definite lack of knowledge of English in this restaurant... from the translation in the menus to the wait-staff.
34770	pos	Sadly you can't keep eating all night, it was time to go home with a big doggy bag.
34771	neg	I scrambled to read as many reviews as I could and knew it was unlikely that I would find someone really good still available with so little lead time.
34772	pos	The stew was topped with a fried egg which added creaminess and texture into the stew.
34773	pos	I confirmed my order over 3 weeks before the wedding and was told that they had everything they needed.
34774	pos	Hubs had the Whole Hog and 12YO had a side of Oreo Pancakes which was still too big for him to finish!

34777	pos	The Carpaccio di Manzo literally melted in your mouth.
34778	pos	Christina saved the day.

34781	pos	The resort is plain and simple.
34782	pos	It wasn't very crowded on Saturday at noon.
34783	neg	However, they forgot about that ordered so we waited until finally we mentioned it and it came out not too long after.
34784	pos	If you're in the Atwater Market area then you should consider picking up some food and having a picnic along the Canal
34785	neg	Now, I'm not too too picky when it comes to pizza, especially when I've got the hunger pains (I've had my share of little Caesars and dominoes) so I was hoping for something a little better than fast food or frozen pizza.
34786	neg	If you have to go to the bathroom, you have walk.
34787	neg	"I was like, ""what the hell"" , I walked a little further and saw the beach entrance of the PH towers."
34788	neg	A couple of weeks ago I had the misfortune to dine at a trendy modern Latin/fusion restaurant miles from here and they served something they passed off as barbacoa (it was more like mop strands soaked in mild chili sauce) the barbacoa I grew up with was done with beef cheeks and/or the meat from the head braised then flash grilled to add some crispy bits.
34789	pos	"The food is sometimes very good, other times very mediocre but we have always liked the place....UNTIL

Last Saturday night we made a fairly large order as we were with friends."

34791	pos	We were lucky to score 6 seats at the bar on a Saturday night.

34794	neg	None of them could take the time to come out, estimate and do the work.
34795	neg	There were multiple empty tables but it was still busy.
34796	pos	Customer service is 2nd to none!!
34797	neg	Dessert was ...eh.
34798	pos	I'm obsessing.
34799	pos	I have been wanting to write a review for a while, but fear the secret will get out!
34800	pos	Also, George was in good humor and we enjoyed his wit.
34801	pos	"Of course, looking at the famed Lobster Tower at the next table, all I can say is ""they were very lucky I ordered too much of my own to attack their table""!"
34802	neg	The only issue I had was the price of the water.
34803	neg	So -5 stars

If all you want is a basket of fried appetizers, huge mugs of cold domestic beer and some screens on which to view your favorite teams, this might be the right place for you."

34807	neg	I had a lot of disappointments maybe cause I was expecting a lot more from the reviews.
34808	neg	Another friend got the duck tacos which were also good, but maybe had too much sauce and were the least impressive of the the dishes we tried.
34809	neg	Unfortunately the suite we were in had temperature issues.
34810	pos	I know the two companies get mixed up in reviews so remember Excellent = Todd and Becca from Scottsdale Segway Tours.
34811	pos	This place is on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for.
34812	neg	No one was at the reception table and two staff members walked passed without an acknowledgement.
34813	pos	Thanks for turning to SOS.
34814	neg	Dessert was a teeny-weeny portion--just enough to have a little bite of dessert.
34815	pos	Shiny, new brochures about 3D Mammography!
34816	pos	He eventually refunded our points and had a tech to fix the game.

34839	pos	I have been to this bar in the past and it was always super packed so this time I was excited since the traffic was slower.
34840	neg	And, yes, it's as schizophrenic as it sounds.
34841	pos	I'll start on a positive note and say the beer selection and quality of their beers is good.
34842	pos	But my friend and I went on a Saturday night, surprisingly it was not as busy as we thought it would be.
34843	neg	The drive through line is always wrapped around the building.
34844	pos	Okay, you don't have to be drinking to appreciate the food, but you probably won't be able to finish it otherwise.
34845	neg	Not family friendly though!
34846	neg	so don't expect many options.
34847	neg	One flaw we noticed was the hostesses sat two walk ins before our reservation we had made weeks prior to our visit.
34848	pos	As for service - we were seated right away which doesn't always happy at restaurants on a Saturday night even with reservations.
34849	pos	Waaayyyy better!!
34850	pos	A great decision for the night... A full weekend next time.
34851	pos	An hour and 45 min wait turned into thirty minutes really quickly.

34859	pos	Before you consider getting a new phone because yours broke, give this place a try.
34860	neg	The last person kept complaining that there is no free parking--well I live in downtown Toronto.

34862	neg	The band they had was awful and we were told they were just fill ins.
34863	neg	YOU chose this job!
34864	pos	I get the feeling that the side of rice and beans are preserved and in their little plates waiting to be ordered.
34865	neg	The only drawbacks are: no affordable food on premise and bit of a walk to the strip (but you can walk through the Fashion Show Mall during the day).
34866	pos	Which is why people probably complement the portion size here.
34867	pos	I have yet to try their Tandoori Chicken, which is probably the only other dish I would try or their Samosas, which I've heard many good things about.
34868	pos	Thanks for the crepe!

34873	pos	love the food.

34878	pos	When we arrived to our 2bedroom suite we fell in love with the amenities and views that we had.

34881	pos	BONUS this place is BYOB we didn't know this but our next visit we will be prepared.
34882	pos	Seems most tortas I've had in AZ are stuffed to the max and fall apart...not here.
34883	pos	Matt called several days later asking if we were happy with our purchase.
34884	neg	At $27 something, it wasn't a cheap meal (since I bought the chips and salsa and Arnold Palmer) but that's money.
34885	pos	We love the Vets too.
34886	neg	Unfortunately lady luck wasn't good to me these past 4 days I said.

34888	pos	I have bought a men's wedding band, an engagement ring, an enhancer for the engagement ring and an anniversary ring which has cost a total of almost $8,000.
34889	neg	Also noticed the floors could of been steam cleaned better some spots look like they used a dirty steam rag .
34890	neg	Opaque tactics from the veterans, rehearsed sales tricks from the new guys, and from the unhinged ones, desperation and pushiness coupled with deaf ears.

34893	pos	I was so happy to see that I was able to reserve on boxing day, my birthday.
34894	neg	They comp club tickets unless it's a holiday weekend, however they can keep the comp bc the club is horrible (see review for club on their yelp).
34895	pos	I'm gonna go bank next week to set some more stuff up!
34896	neg	1)  The staff has no training in relating to the customer.
34897	pos	My friends and I were very excited to try Poros for a birthday celebration.
34898	pos	Other than that, dumplings were tasty
34899	pos	We ordered 7 types of dimsum and all the food came very, very quickly - like all of it within 5-10 minutes of ordering, which is very fast for a typical restaurant at peak lunch time on a weekend.
34900	pos	As someone who worked in the industry for a decade, I can honestly say I've never seen anything remotely comparable to this.
34901	neg	They basically will just come out to take the service repair fee (gone in under 25 minutes).

35193	pos	It truly saddens me to see such bad reviews for this place.
35194	pos	On top of that they had dessert as part of the deal which was a literal icing on the sushi cake(that sounds pretty gross now that I see it in writing).
35195	neg	I got a call this morning from Josh, alerting me that the technician would be late, and he apologized.
35196	neg	My one complain is the Subaru dealer in my previous town would give you a free car wash every time you came in for service...they do not seem to do that here.

35227	pos	My family and I love Einstein Bagels.
35228	pos	We can come back again and again.

35770	pos	I was late for the inspection but they did not rush through anything with me.

35842	pos	We arrived on time, picked out polish and were taken right back to our chairs.
35843	pos	A little high, but the certificate was for $25 with $35 minimum purchase, which made it worth it.
35844	pos	The price was very cheat for the amount we got.

35848	neg	I have to say that I was a little surprised to learn that there was no casino.

35869	pos	Cool you have a band, but we came to eat.
35870	pos	I absolutely NEED to live in walking distance from this place so I can relive the glory days of my 20's, wondering into the local video rental place with friends and spending more time oohing over selections than it will actually take to watch mine once I get home with it.

36596	neg	The deal we had was with the guest who placed their order behind us receiving OUR FOOD!
36597	pos	Standard Apple customer experience.
36598	neg	Only downfall is that when I try to call and place an order for pick up no one speaks English and she hung up on me.

36611	pos	I love that they didn't make it gigantic size.
36612	neg	My only complaint is that it doesn't have an all-you-can-eat option, which I suppose would make the service level fall, the quality diminish, and the presentation falter.

36614	pos	My buddy and I booked two rooms in July 2014 because we love the balconies (FYI Cosmopolitan  property beautiful balconies).

36642	neg	Just picture a house with 2 kids, 2 dogs, 2 working parents, and a newborn on the way... we probably haven't cleaned in months... and we had piles and piles of clothes, dishes, toys, junk, etc EVERYWHERE.

36644	pos	Instead of having to go inside and deal with the cashier he had took our I.d and card while we drove through the car wash- upon exiting returned the I.d/card.

36664	pos	They advertise daily happy hour  with $4 Margaritas + $3 well drinks, among other offers.

36697	pos	I went there and 30 minutes later my recall was fixed and car was washed no charge.
36698	neg	While no one breaks up because of a 90 minute wait alone and perhaps Globe did me a favor by making me ex-boyfriend lose it then..... still, when you drop a few hundred dollars on a bill, you expect to get service and a pleasant experience, not a miserable one.
36699	pos	Server was polite and asked if I would like to order something else - which I did.
36700	neg	With that said, the restaurant looked like it could have really used some updating and new furniture.

36715	pos	I have dined at Chicago Joe's several times over the past 15 years and it has always been a nice place to go for a solid Italian meal.
36716	pos	Rich, chocolatety ( a flavour profile with no actual chocolate), and a finish that just lasted and lasted would be an accurate description.
36717	neg	poor guys.

36735	pos	I thanked her, she thanked me, and she directed me towards my room.

36766	neg	Still no guy.

36860	neg	It's all a mashup of shit, with a floor above.
36861	pos	Other than that minor hiccup, our water glasses were kept full, adult drinks brought to the table in a timely fashion, and plenty of meat, meat, meat.
36862	neg	I'm sure our bridal party was not the easiest to deal with, since they are a little crazy and do drink a little..  ok a lot..
36863	pos	The Abbey seemed to fulfill all necessary criteria.
36864	neg	I can't afford health insurance since I'm self-employed and have a garnishment that claims fifty percent of my income, and yet nobody sent that message to the illnesses that come my way.
36865	neg	Turns out insurance wanted more per month for the CBR, so I went back to the CB.
36866	neg	No worries I thought, worse things could happen.

36873	pos	My son was with me and the agent offered him water and an ipad game to play.
36874	neg	We were LIVID.
36875	neg	You lazy pricks.

36881	neg	My wife and I really gave this place a chance with four visits.

36883	neg	But recently due to salmon prices rising their salmon pieces are shrinking not only here all other places as well.
36884	neg	The carpet had a ton of pulling/folding (which we learned was from poor installation) as well as a few spots where our cat licked the carpet into tufts.

36902	pos	Breaking down the numbers, the house was initially listed at $440,000.
36903	neg	I have worked in the customer service industry for 14 years myself and I have always been told if you are charging a customer the big bucks...instead of making excuses as to why it's so high in price you explain to the customer as of WHY it is priced that way.. quality, warrenty ..you educate the customer, NOT make them feel or treated as a pauper!
36904	neg	It is served with some veggies but they were so thinly sliced that when you dip it into the broth, it shrivels up to become more miniscule and hard to taste.
36905	pos	You were probably the most helpful customer service person I've ever met.
36906	pos	I used to go here often back in the day in 2008 and it was pretty good.
36907	pos	The food was edible.
36908	neg	Desk staff I really don't deal with a whole lot except when purchasing product (B&B) or calling to make an appointment and they're so busy it seems I'm on hold quite a bit.

36913	pos	Let me tell you, I have been to France, but never eaten like this.
36914	pos	Since I was so desperate for my career change, my love life, my happiness, I wanted to do it.
36915	pos	Literally minutes for our main dishes to be served.
36916	pos	We arrived around 4pm so the restaurant was not busy at all.
36917	neg	Try not to get a table near the bar.
36918	pos	I not only make it a point to visit the spa at the hotels I stay at in Vegas but I also love to pamper myself with massages and spa visits here at home so I am seasoned a spa goer.

36920	pos	Looks nice.
36921	pos	She apologized profusely, investigated the matter and then called me back again.
36922	pos	Checked in early and asked if we can get early check in.
36923	neg	They are rather expensive put they have so many different styles and options.

36927	pos	"Our sales rep Josie was one of the best being our first vehicle we buy,
She treated us like we know each other for years."
36928	pos	I took it upon myself to dig in the area and found a cracked pipe.
36929	neg	(Honestly, with the 9000 cards from each and every store out there these days, I'd have to be a pack mule to carry all those things.).
36930	pos	We made a reservation, arrived on time and were seated no problem.
36931	pos	I sat in their outside patio which was pleasant.
36932	pos	Instead it was a nice place with inside booths and a cool patio.
36933	neg	Unfortunately, I cannot say the same regarding the Aveda store in Philadelphia.
36934	neg	(A personal facial pet peeve of mine is when the therapist leaves for 10 minutes while you are being steamed -- I am talking to you, Ici Paris on the Danforth).
36935	neg	So he still doesnt beleive me an goes to look at my Jeep himself, what do you knownhe fixes the charge on the ticket when he sees there is no 3rd row.
36936	neg	So...I will admit walking in and for there to be no customers and only seeing 1 guy working made me think twice if I just made a mistake.
36937	pos	The other order was parfait with yogurt and fruit which was very good.
36938	neg	That includes the weird spidery head massagers that random mall vendors are always hawking.
36939	pos	If I were to rate the food, I would give it five stars.
36940	neg	Only negative is they have no espresso machine.
36941	pos	My buddy, Josh, and I decided we had to return the next night.

36946	pos	Once my friends arrived, our waitress promptly asked if we had been served yet and took our orders.
36947	neg	However, it meant leaving her there for up to 5-hrs, and when we finally get her home she's so thirsty and somewhat traumatized.
36948	pos	Wonderful.
36949	pos	On your Bday they send ya a $10 gift card.
36950	neg	With large chains such as BK, McD, etc you come to expect [reasonably so, IMO] a certain standard, uniformly applied to every location; and usually this is the case, which makes this particular location stand out like a sore thumb.
36951	pos	The duck was somewhat of a saving grace.
36952	pos	It seemed fresh and was nice.
36953	pos	My boyfriend and I were visiting Charlotte for about a week from Los Angeles, and I can say that the comics we saw at the 10pm explicit show on a Friday Night were more entertaining than the comics we had to pay twice as much to see in LA a month or so earlier.
36954	pos	If it's due to a high level of training and expectations set, then keep doing what you do!
36955	pos	The buffet at Terrible's wasn't the best but at affordable prices and the frequent BOGO tickets that could be found, the low price trumped the limited selection.
36956	pos	The lady said she'd get back to me in a couple of hours, which she actually did.
36957	pos	"Not that over the top typical ""Mexican restaurant"" atmosphere with the colorful wooden chairs that's sooo overdone."
36958	pos	My GF and I were there playing the machines before going to eat because we had heard some good things about the food for the price.
36959	pos	The only thing missing from this place was a pool.
36960	neg	Burnt hot dogs, stale buns, dry pizza, stale pretzels.

36963	pos	The staff was always very nice when I would come in and they did confirm appointments regularly.
36964	neg	I would give the food 4/5, only because of small portions for what you pay.
36965	neg	My hair already is very stubborn about taking color, but thanks to my double botched job, that pink-hued mess didn't want to budge.
36966	pos	Go to Floyds or ANY other place, their true colors showed through.
36967	pos	Decided to go through with the unit he recommended and installers were out the very next morning.
36968	neg	The food was excellent but overshadowed by the service.
36969	neg	As for the sausages being overpriced, c'mon, really?
36970	pos	But the coffee still hit the spot.
36971	neg	The interesting thing was their were several other children that came in during the time (all white)we were there, and none of them were treated as badly as my sweet five-year-old biracial daughter!

36976	neg	I thought the bread was evil but the butter cake Is the devil incarnate.
36977	neg	I think I even fell asleep at one point!
36978	neg	The only downside is the incredibly long lines all evening.

36980	pos	And so cheap!
36981	pos	I managed to con one of my co-workers into coming with me; she was very pregnant at the time.
36982	neg	It's hard to believe that my Little Man Kylie is no longer with me.
36983	pos	The food came out quick, and they had a nice open kitchen.
36984	pos	That was going to take this to a whole new level.
36985	neg	It's not bad, it's not good, it's just meh.
36986	neg	there are times when I dont want to cook at all but have to as there was no resturant which delivered halal and delicious desi food.
36987	neg	We thought the server got fired or something, until in the end she showed up with the bill.
36988	pos	She absolutely RAVED about it.
36989	pos	She looked fabulous when her hair was finished being cut by another stylist.
36990	pos	I can't remember what was going on, but Front street was closed off for an event so it was fun to people watch.
36991	pos	Be careful, your eyes maybe bigger than your stomach
36992	pos	My bf and I decided to give it a try after I was raving about it to him.
36993	pos	The whole car looked like new, including salt stains and glass that I hadn't been able to get out myself when it was broken into.
36994	pos	If I lived in Montreal, I would be a regular here.
36995	pos	Kabobs here are bombdigity.
36996	neg	The all you can eat apparently comes with a free side, which includes stuff like miso soup and a free dessert, which we were never able to try.
36997	pos	They will be definitely getting an earful from me on Monday morning.
36998	pos	They were gracious, honest and a really nicely ran little office.
36999	neg	You're already charging me more than the price of the room and you're taxing it too?
37000	pos	I still can't get that homemade mustard out of my dreams..
37001	pos	The server quickly went into the kitchen to get my salad started.
37002	neg	One concern .
37003	pos	Don't even think twice about getting it.
37004	pos	One night, at the table next to me, a man who I am assuming was a magician pulled a bunch of doves out of a box.
37005	neg	Marrell charged me $37!
37006	neg	It's way across town from me and I wondered why we needed to drive so far for just a buffet.
37007	pos	I was absolutely floored!
37008	neg	I expected blackened meat all around, like I've seen on the Food Network, and these were just the black ring around brisket that I normally get... when I order brisket.
37009	pos	Mongolian beef was good, but I'm a harsh critic on this dish, because the chinese restaurant in our old neighborhood had the best one I've ever had.
37010	neg	Requested blue cheese since the ranch was near water and got more ranch and was charged.
37011	neg	Better Security and hopefully less low life scum hanging in the parking lot to potentially assault you.
37012	pos	My husband and I are huge Rita's fans.
37013	pos	When i went up to pay i got really good vibes from the gentleman helping me he was super friendly.

37017	pos	Charming.
37018	neg	Took a while to get them on my table.
37019	pos	No alcohol and while a beer would have been great, it definitely shouldn't keep you from going for a nice binge.
37020	neg	There are no little structures for dogs to go through, basically it's just a plot of grassy land for the dogs to run around in.
37021	pos	My self control goes out the window when it comes to this place's buffet!
37022	neg	"But this is not a ""blow your mind with something new"" kind of place."

37032	pos	Boy was I wrong to pre-judge.
37033	neg	Why is the line always backed up and slow.
37034	pos	Delivery times never exceed 30-40 minutes.
37035	pos	Our bread sticks finally arrived just as we finished our meals and were too full to eat more than a bite of them.

37042	pos	I did like the domestic violence scene where the guy almost chokes the girl.
37043	neg	I am sorry someone else had a neg experience...
37044	neg	They will get annoyed with you and make it very apparent.
37045	pos	The facilities are great and attract you to the school at first.
37046	pos	Let's hope for the best..
37047	pos	Rich suggested I get a paint correction and gloss coating.
37048	pos	The food is simply sensacional!!
37049	pos	We saw the inspection score of 96.5 as we walked in so that made us feel better.
37050	neg	I've found their cocktails to be overly-sweet, but to be fair I've only tried a few.
37051	neg	A packed store,  customers needing help, we were tired of waiting- and now this.

37053	pos	They don't lie.

37057	pos	If there's good weather, I suggest an outside table.
37058	neg	I'm not sure what the issue was but people were taking on average 5 minutes.
37059	pos	Instead, she gave me useful tips on how to prevent sun damage, how to care for my dry hair, and how to balance my oily roots with my dry ends.
37060	neg	Only negative -- Steve Wynn's voice overs -- after a while they're just on the grating side.
37061	neg	I had an unlicensed landscaper come out and they took my money and did a poor job, spent 3 weeks giving me the run around and gave me a lot of anxiety (I know, my fault).
37062	pos	"Ha ha ha   

Thankfully, the representative helping us was awesome and saved the day!"
37063	pos	Nothing about this place I didn't love outside of the prices- which are typical for Vegas, the Cosmo and this upscale of a restaurant.
37064	neg	Don't pay attention to the review below saying that this place is good, I honestly think that was written by someone that works there.
37065	neg	If you're heading back to the US, just remember that you'll be dealing with the border about a half-hour after leaving and that might not work out too well.
37066	neg	We also tried the beignets and although the breading was good/different the dipping sauce wasn't pleasing... more of a coffee based sauce that I wasn't a fan of.
37067	neg	The line can get long and the chairs and umbrellas go quick.
37068	pos	Beet salad, carrot soup and spaghetti were delicious.
37069	pos	It's a good store with affordable prices but that one person can ruin your whole experience shopping at this particular No frills.
37070	pos	The dipping sauce is unbelievable.
37071	neg	In addition, get your staff on the same page... actually you know what?
37072	neg	Seems all the negative comments are from Scottsdale snobs and whiney little spoiled people.
37073	pos	By the way EAT24 is a great app, and easy to use.
37074	pos	Which tasted great.
37075	neg	It's SUPER small inside - literally only has 3 tables, so I would DEFINITELY call ahead before planning to eat-in here.
37076	neg	I was a fan of the beef on top but not so much of the sauce they juiced it with it was a bit too much.
37077	neg	They SCAMMED US!
37078	pos	Three stars for cleanliness and polite staff.
37079	neg	I could not taste the lychee at all.
37080	pos	The place is pretty and well decorated.
37081	pos	She gave me four free treatments which I appreciated and recently finished.
37082	pos	Chima looked really nice on the outside, and the inside was decorated in a very contemporary fashion.
37083	neg	He might be a traitor.
37084	neg	That triggered me really hard.
37085	neg	I'd like to see a corporate person go through there drive through and tell me it was good.
37086	pos	The only thing that would have made this dining experience even more perfect would have been the option of ordering guacamole with the chips and salsa.
37087	pos	That was the best part.
37088	pos	I wish the rating system for Yelp went to ELEVEN.
37089	neg	Upon doing our first load of laundry in our new house, sewer water came up in both our bathrooms.

37091	pos	(Seriously, they have a gazillion different colors.)
37092	pos	$6 Domestic pitchers all the time.
37093	pos	The serving size is big, so I think we would have been fine with just the curry.
37094	pos	Usually the experiences aren't that bad.
37095	neg	You are only served one (large) but it is kinds of lonely on the plate.
37096	neg	Most cities, if you don't walk in dripping in diamonds with a frozen plastic face, they won't give you the time of day.
37097	neg	She was disappointed with the flavor.
37098	neg	I would defiantly order something else on the menu.
37099	pos	Most of the time there's only short line up or no line up at all.
37100	pos	I work in insurance and we always recommend Reliable Glass to anyone who is looking for windshield repairs.
37101	pos	I take complete control of the meal here and order the standard Margherita, which all pizza-heads know is the standardized test of a purportedly authentic Neapolitan style pie.
37102	pos	The staff have always been nice to me and I usually come in for a manicure, shellac manicure, and have had acrylics applied once and removed twice.
37103	pos	I waved the server over, I think her name was Natasha or Natalie, and she hurried right over.
37104	neg	This isn't a place to linger for hours.
37105	pos	You came in the next morning and did 3 hours worth of work in under 45 min.
37106	pos	I had to have him repeat the amount like 3 times because it just sounded too good to be true.
37107	neg	Ordered Kalua without cabbage and they accidentally cooked it with.
37108	neg	But when I went to order it tonight, it said that my current address was not within their delivery distance so I have to go pick it up now.
37109	neg	That would be the only inconvenience of the whole hotel, many taxi rides.
37110	pos	So... Let me say this; my husband and I come here often.. We LOVE LOVE LOVE the food!!
37111	pos	Plenty of room for large parties and other clients.
37112	neg	Opposite, I got an extra drink in our bill but I paid without saying a word to not need to stay longer!!!
37113	pos	First visit went fairly smooth.
37114	neg	What a bunch of whiny Southwesterners.
37115	neg	Once we finally sat down it didn't get any better.
37116	neg	Only knock would be my view from my room which was of a construction site, but not a huge deal.
37117	pos	Man I miss their ranch, it was really something special.
37118	pos	Also, the salad that comes with the meal is pretty standard.
37119	pos	The atmosphere was upscale but not froufrou or intimidating.
37120	neg	the venue generally is spotless at the beginning of the night, but not by the end sadly.
37121	pos	So I have been going into store #866 which is the store I received all these prizes at and have been getting my free donuts and coffee occasionally and also have talked with several of the store managers who have allowed me to pay the difference between the regular dozen and mixed dozen so I can enjoy all your donuts not just the plain glazed donuts, and I don't mind paying the extra cash out of pocket so I can enjoy all your donuts at a minimal cost, and KK is not taking a total loss on donuts by just giving them to me for free, it was also explained that due to the fact that I might not get a dozen donuts every week, I can get multiple donuts and they will stamp my card accordingly until I get my 52 dozen.
37122	pos	"Forgot to mention that the ""non refundable"" $50 deposit I paid for the property I wanted to rent was refunded to me after Kumiko fought for me to get it back."
37123	neg	Incompetence at its finest... Worth the drive to another location...
37124	neg	"Hot Thai Jelly Bean

It's a dive."
37125	pos	GREAT manager!
37126	pos	The french toast was killer.
37127	neg	It may be cheap but it is better to actually enjoy your vacation than to lose hours to this service.
37128	pos	He told me HAVE A NICE DAY!
37129	pos	I thought great!
37130	pos	First time my boss wanted me to go for lunch.
37131	neg	Cons: as you can see, the regular sushi ($3 for 1 roll 6 pieces) is a little small, but reasonable for the price.
37132	pos	It was almost too pretty to eat!
37133	pos	I've paid way more in Vegas and I can't say I've even been as pleased.
37134	pos	They even always try and get me into the best loaner car they have.
37135	neg	In and out burger was my favorite but not anymore.
37136	pos	It's just 25 minutes and burns up to 24% of my fat cells - yippee!

37287	neg	Tough approach, yes, uncaring, you betcha.
37288	pos	However, the service was excellent.
37289	neg	If the line for regular customers gets long, they stop passport services and deal with the regular customers first, so if it's a busy day you are SOL.

37338	neg	Until you get those n00bs in line that speak too quietly or don't know what they want which in that situation nothing can be helped.

37355	neg	Dangerous to have nearby.
37356	pos	Excellent approach, Brasseurs.

37370	neg	The risotto that I ordered for my entree was too salty, and probably needed more cream.
37371	neg	No coffee lover will use powdered cream.

37384	neg	I had extensions in before moving out here and my hair was damaged from removing the extensions.
37385	pos	We grabbed a couple of seats at the bar and were immediately greeted by one of the three bartenders (one of whom was Kit himself) and given a draft list.
37386	pos	While a little farther away from our home in North Scottsdale, it is worth the extra 15 minutes of my time.

37396	neg	The back tire was flattened, the hubcaps were knocked off and the whole driver's side of the car was scratched from bumper to hood.
37397	neg	The final straw that compelled me to find a new pharmacy was when the clerk at Walgreens told me that I would have to literally call them every single time I got certain things filled so they could run it again with the co-pay assistance applied.
37398	pos	All of his seafood is less than 24 hours old, flown to Phoenix from the Tokyo fish market daily.
37399	neg	Clearly the owner doesn't give a shit, based on reviews, quality of food hasn't changed since the initial complaint lol.
37400	pos	My feet came in in bad shape and left looking great.
37401	neg	I also had a fun fringe dress for my reception that was too long and loose on me as well.
37402	pos	We got our food in a reasonable amount of time, but my friend got her food first.
37403	pos	The waiter came by to ask us if everything was good and the query died on his lips when he saw the nearly empty bowls of noodles, chicken and Cambodian goodness.
37404	pos	I have a suppressed SBR semi I can shoot in my own yard all day.
37405	pos	We left extremely full so for 3 people you could order less than what we did.

38504	pos	They had to do this application on the hod several times with lesser expensive wrapping vinyl to get the stripes to conform to the proper pattern and let me tel you this was a BIG challenge.
38505	neg	Maybe the guests sitting next to us are high rollers but it doesn't mean that our table should be neglected.
38506	pos	They work REALLY well when you don't need them :)  I keep myself healthy by eating well and exercising so I have only had routine exams with them.

39811	neg	Would love to eat any chain's pizza over this.
39812	neg	Not the best idea.
